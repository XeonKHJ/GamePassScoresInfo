Forever.\r\n\r\nNEW BROS\r\nHarness the calculating intelligence and acid-spitting allure of Seth Brondle, wield Xebro’s flying Chakram, serenade (and grenade) terrorism with the flamenco firebrand Desperabro, or become the thing monsters have nightmares about, a stake throwing, unholy purging, self-resurrecting teenage Slayer!\r\n\r\nIf sniping is more your style, famed bug hunter Bro Gummer brings pinpoint liberation with his trusty rifle, while Demolition Bro’s Freeze Grenades put evildoers right back where they belong… ON ICE.\r\n\r\nNEW BADDIES\r\nA Bro only becomes a force when confronted with those who seek to destroy their freedoms, and in Broforce Forever, the terrorists are even more determined to delete democracy. Motorbike Maniacs will try to run you down, while machine gun placements, barbed wire, sandbags and bazooka-laden blimps conspire to make each visit to occupied territory a very, very bad day at the broffice.\r\n\r\nNEW CHALLENGES\r\nBros in search of even bigger battles can flex their muscles in new challenge levels known as Muscle Temples. Each campaign tasks Indiana Brones with navigating a perilous temple that features a new Threat Level and specific enemy types and hazards. Succeed and unlock one of four new flexes that can be deployed by any Bro, any time, any place. Just like freedom.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nWhen evil threatens the world, the world calls on Broforce - an under-funded, over-powered paramilitary organization dealing exclusively in excessive force. Brace your loins with up to four players to run ‘n’ gun as dozens of different bros and eliminate the opposing terrorist forces that threaten our way of life."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"broforce","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8932.14468359839778606.9e6e7f7a-1cbd-4014-9079-c80741e5d745.74e3ed6d-8487-4e92-8b67-462657f07e8d","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58152.14468359839778606.9e6e7f7a-1cbd-4014-9079-c80741e5d745.e535f0a1-7705-4fde-945a-7ace4558f12a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4607.14468359839778606.9e6e7f7a-1cbd-4014-9079-c80741e5d745.fd988af6-52ed-490e-bb1d-a3f687cead11","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26936.14468359839778606.9e6e7f7a-1cbd-4014-9079-c80741e5d745.5fa9f801-d484-4c2b-9ff8-9b9252def750","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50163.14468359839778606.9e6e7f7a-1cbd-4014-9079-c80741e5d745.0dfb5a68-f7df-4f88-a230-8ee4956fa87a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17306.14468359839778606.9e6e7f7a-1cbd-4014-9079-c80741e5d745.ba77f7e2-b490-4ce2-a486-d4f739284df2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49886.14468359839778606.9e6e7f7a-1cbd-4014-9079-c80741e5d745.88e48337-3e35-46f1-9b4f-ae78528df9ea","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.401.14468359839778606.9e6e7f7a-1cbd-4014-9079-c80741e5d745.a36f0a83-962b-4786-bb55-6e186e441e1a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51499.14468359839778606.9e6e7f7a-1cbd-4014-9079-c80741e5d745.7b1adb37-807a-4176-93ca-2bd960085646"],"ReleaseDate":5248642622427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":558551040},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/broken-age/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":76},"ID":"9MZZNL8J2MSZ","Title":{"en-us":"Broken Age"},"Description":{"en-us":"Broken Age is a timeless coming-of-age story of barfing trees and talking spoons.

Design, build, and manage the city of your dreams, from public services to civic policies, and challenge yourself to grow from a simple town to a bustling metropolitan hub.\r\n\r\nCities: Skylines is an award-winning, best-selling management game, now available for Windows 10 with all of its robust city-simulation gameplay and unique charm along for the ride. The Windows 10 Edition includes the base game and the popular After Dark expansion, allowing players to plan and design for their cities’ nightlife and tourist attractions.\r\n\r\nMain Features:\r\n- Build the city of your dreams: Plan road networks, bus lines and parks. Bring on a smog-filled industrial revolution or create a quiet beach town ideal for tourists powered by renewable energy. Bring education, healthcare and safety to your citizens. Build it your way!\r\n\r\n- Multi-tiered and challenging simulation: Playing as the mayor of your city, you’ll be faced with balancing essential requirements such as education, water electricity, police, firefighting, healthcare and much more, along with your city’s economy. Citizens within your city react fluidly, keeping you on your toes with ever-evolving demands.\r\n\r\n- Extensive local traffic simulation: Managing traffic and the needs of your citizens to work and play will require the use of several interactive transport systems – use careful road planning alongside buses, trains, subways, and much more.\r\n\r\n- Districts and policies: Be more than just another city hall official! Create a car-free downtown area, assign free public transport to your waterfront, or ban pets in suburbia. Designate parts of your city as a district in order to set policy at the local level, and give different parts of town their own personalities.\r\n\r\n- After Dark included: Watch your city become an entirely different place at night: a day-night cycle will have your citizens seeking out places to unwind after work. Add in new policies and zones to create popular hotspots and provide enough taxis and trains to get to and from the clubs!\r\n"},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"cities-skylines","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38447.14442149246756025.e0e6c583-8325-415d-813c-e90e0ab7057a.309e5a51-4e69-41a1-8d19-d19c72140230","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5247993506427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":17274967293},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Simulation"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/cities-skylines-ii/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":75},"ID":"9PGZ346PSLN0","Title":{"en":"Cities: Skylines II - PC Edition"},"Description":{"en":"If you can dream it, you can build it.\r\nRaise a city from the ground up and transform it into the thriving metropolis only you can imagine.

Players returning to Erlin’s Eye might even find themselves running into some familiar faces!\r\n\r\n\r\nROLEPLAYING IN THE RUINS OF INTERPLANETARY CAPITALISM\r\nOne of 2022’s most acclaimed indies, the Game Awards-nominated Citizen Sleeper is a Tabletop-inspired narrative RPG set on Erlin’s Eye, a ruined space station that is home to thousands of people trying to survive on the edges of an interstellar capitalist society. \r\n\r\nYou are a sleeper, a digitised human consciousness in an artificial body, owned by a corporation that wants you back. Thrust amongst the unfamiliar and colourful inhabitants of the Eye, you need to build friendships, earn your keep, and navigate the factions of this strange metropolis, if you hope to survive to see the next cycle.\r\n\r\nROLL THE DICE. DO THE WORK. GET PAID. SURVIVE.\r\nInspired by Tabletop Roleplaying games, Citizen Sleeper uses Dice, Clocks and Drives  to create a player-led experience, where you choose your path in a rich and responsive world. Each cycle you use the dice you are dealt to choose what to do with your time. Make or break alliances, uncover truths and escape your hunters. Survive and ultimately thrive, one cycle at a time, and sometimes against the clock!\r\n\r\nTURN UP FOR YOUR FRIENDS\r\nThe station plays host to characters from all walks of life, trying to eke out an existence among the stars. Salvagers, engineers, hackers, bartenders, street-food vendors, each has a history which brought them here. You choose which of them you wish to help, and together you will shape your future.\r\n\r\nACCESS THEIR SECRETS\r\nEventually, you will learn to use your dice to hack into the station’s cloud to access decades of digital data, uncover new areas and unlock secrets. This is your unique power, and with it you can change your future. Corporate secrets, rogue AIs and troves of lost data await those willing to dive into the depths of the station’s networks.\r\n\r\nYOU WERE MADE TO DIE\r\nEssen-Arp: to them you are just property, one more asset in a portfolio that stretches across the stars. You are the product of an abusive system, in a universe where humanity’s expansion is marked by exploitation and extraction.

On top of that there are over 120 ingredients available in the pantry: meat and fish, fruit and veggies, dairy products and various liquids. There’s also a full set of spices and herbs for adding that extra flavour!\r\n\r\nLifelike cooking experience! All the ingredients respond to your actions by changing temperature, appearance and taste. Every time you’re slicing potatoes, flipping steaks or boiling a soup, there are some real-life physics applied to it. Once you learn the cooking mechanics and start serving dishes, you’ll see yourself becoming a better chef with every new plate on the checkout.\r\n\r\nCareer mode is a culinary journey zero-to-hero style and your task is to gain fame for you and your restaurant. You’ll start from the basics and progressively unlock new more complex dishes and start serving more customers as your fame and experience grow. Once you master the recipes and workflow, you’ll be able to unlock various perks and skills.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you’re not interested in playing by the rules, you’re going to love the Sandbox mode. Access all the recipes and ingredients and prepare whatever you like without any pressure. You don’t even have to cook anything! Game physics gives you unlimited opportunities. Throw knives like darts, set up cutting boards like dominoes, set the whole kitchen on fire, blow up the oven and save the day using a fire extinguisher!\r\n\r\nLeaderboard Challenge. Ever wanted to prove that you are the best chef around? Well, now you can! Pick an order and take it to the kitchen. No distractions, just one simple goal – serve the best dish you can, as fast as you can. Based on this performance, the game will calculate your score and place you on a leaderboard (each recipe has its own). Become an expert at one dish or master them all!"},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"cooking-simulator","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61226.14318332024941603.bcd56dc7-63bc-4d56-bf05-e25c65cd0318.143a922e-35a6-4bdb-9d8b-3e53a7fca595","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5249644250427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":4997259264},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Role playing","Simulation"],"MetacriticUrls":{},"MetaScore":{},"ID":"9N1T1MQ92PVS","Title":{"en":"Coral Island (Game Preview)"},"Description":{"en":"This game is a work in progress.

Choose your noble house and lead your dynasty to greatness in a Middle Ages epic that spans generations. War is but one of many tools to establish your reign, as real strategy requires expert diplomatic skill, mastery of your realm, and true cunning. Crusader Kings III continues the popular series made by Paradox Development Studio, featuring the widely acclaimed marriage of immersive grand strategy and deep, dramatic medieval roleplaying. \r\n\r\n\r\nA bloodline begins\r\n  \r\n• Take command of your house and expand your dynasty through a meticulously researched Middle Ages. Begin in 867 or 1066 and claim lands, titles, and vassals to secure a realm worthy of your royal blood. Your death is only a footnote as your lineage continues with new playable heirs, either planned… or not. \r\n• Discover a sprawling simulated world teeming with peasants and knights, courtiers, spies, knaves and jesters, and secret love affairs. An extensive cast of historical characters can be romanced, betrayed, executed, or subtly influenced.  \r\n• Explore a vast medieval map stretching from the snowswept Nordic lands to the Horn of Africa, and the British Isles in the west to the exotic riches of Burma in the east. Claim, conquer, and rule thousands of unique counties, duchies, kingdoms, and empires. \r\n\r\n\r\nLarger than life \r\n\r\n• Each character is larger than life, with traits and lifestyle choices determining their actions and schemes. Prompt fear and dread as you rule with an iron fist, or inspire your subjects with magnanimous deeds. Genetics can be passed along to your children, be it the gift of genius or crippling stupidity. \r\n• Groom your heir with the appropriate guardians or educate them yourself. If found wanting, marry them off or despatch them through other means. \r\n• Customize your ruler and noble house, from appearance to attributes, and create a monarch worthy of all their inherited virtues and vices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReal strategy requires cunning\r\n\r\n• Govern an ever-evolving realm and grant titles to whom you see fit - or usurp your liege to claim their crown as your own. Be wary of rivals, from restless serfs to revengeful concubines. \r\n• The shadows stir frequently, and danger lurks around every darkened corner. Recruit agents and other unsavory elements to undermine, blackmail, or murder those who stand in your path. Or be inspired by the bard and ballad, and seduce your way to power and influence.\r\n• Blood will flow. Assemble men-at-arms units and powerful knights. Manage your battlefield tactics and armies. Raid and plunder nearby lands or hire mercenaries and Holy Orders for your major conflicts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccomplish great things\r\n\r\n• Be a pious king to invite the religious powers to your side, or design your own faith as you battle between everlasting fame or eternal damnation.\r\n• Bring novel innovations to your culture and construct mighty castles and bastions to increase the wealth, prestige, and security of your realm. \r\n• The paths to follow are limitless: experience thousands of dynamic events and life-altering decisions tailored to each and every conceivable situation and character. There are countless ways of securing and keeping your place in the history books. \r\n\r\n"},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"crusader-kings-iii","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25959.14065406176999862.d433bba3-dfb8-463a-bd60-0c7bd30829d8.8a527e59-eb28-4692-a0cf-f4be29c66f58","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5249031746427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":11636289536},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Shooter"],"MetacriticUrls":{"Xbox360":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/crysis-3/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-360"},"MetaScore":{"Xbox360":76},"ID":"9PNRHXZ6ZSS9","Title":{"en":"Crysis 3"},"Description":{"en":"The fate of the world is in your hands.

Its chilling environment was infested with disfigured creatures who spent the entire game roaming the hallways and coming up with new ways to kill. The head-removing, arm-slicing, blood-splattering action left gamers paralyzed with fear — and hungry for more. Now you can download Dead Space 2 to your PC and give yourself more reasons to sleep with both eyes open.\r\n\r\nIsaac Clarke’s story continues as he wakes from a coma in a city simply known as “The Sprawl.” Before he can get his bearings, the city is attacked by Necromorphs, the same creatures that made his life a bone-chilling hell the first time around. Confused, disoriented, and scared out of his mind, Isaac must battle the hideous creatures that have driven him insane.\r\n\r\nAlong with better weapons and more zero-gravity environments, Dead Space 2 takes away the silent protagonist and gives Isaac a voice, letting the player hear his reactions to horror that surrounds him.

In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop.\r\n\r\nIF AT FIRST YOU DON’T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN \r\nEvery new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you’ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you’ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted.\r\n\r\nSINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER \r\nAre you the hero or the villain? You’ll experience DEATHLOOP’s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you’ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you’re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna’s stylish sneakers and invade another player’s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign.\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF – PARADISE OR PRISON    \r\nArkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.

Gather your Evilness in new and dynamic ways and unleash it upon the lush green forests and plains of the Overworld to turn them over to the dark side. But make sure that your Dungeon is well-secured by traps and defended by your creatures, for those pesky Overworlders won’t just twiddle their thumbs while you turn their land into the Absolute Evil’s most pleasurable holiday paradise. \r\n\r\nBut what is that noise? “Gold, gold, gold and gems, gold and gems and gold!” The ancient song echoes throughout the underworld, accompanied by the clanging steel of hammers and axes. The Dwarves have arrived to claim their share of the abundant resources and together with the Elves and Humans of the Overworld, they send out their raiding parties to find the Dungeon’s heart.\r\n\r\nDungeons 4 keeps the spirit of its predecessor, but everything is now bigger, better, and with even more dynamic Evilness™.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n• Everything is better with Dwarves™: The Dwarves have arrived to build their underground strongholds and the hardy little fellows (although they don’t like being called that) compete with the Ever-Expanding Evil for space and resources.\r\n\r\n• It makes your Dungeon great again: Dungeons are up four times larger than before and there are many more creatures who wait for the All-Commanding Evil’s orders to conquer the Overworld. Now the time has come for massive armies and truly sprawling dungeons!\r\n\r\n• Ripe for the taking: The Overworld is bigger than ever before. Gain Evilness by beating Mini Bosses like the obsessively harmonious Unicorn and use it to transform the Overworld into stunning biomes of pure evil. \r\n\r\n• New and shiny: An ability-based Perk system for Thalya, the Absolute Evil’s trusted *cough* and most loyal subordinate, grants her impressive new powers. The Absolute Evil can now enjoy taking over the world, governing the creatures and slapping subordinates even more with the customizable Evil Hand.\r\n\r\n• Minions, everywhere: The Horde, the Undead and the Demons wait to do the Absolute Evil’s bidding, with more creatures than ever eagerly following the gesturing Evil’s orders, and Snots will play a much more prominent role this time.\r\n\r\n• Many ways to tell the story: A long campaign, narrated by the beloved English Narrator from previous titles, as well as several skirmish maps all to challenge your rule as the Absolute Evil.\r\n\r\n• Change the world: Spread your Evilness across the Overworld to bring lush and green environments over to the dark side, now shining even more vibrantly and beautifully evil as you spread your evilness across many new biomes.\r\n\r\n• Work together, slay together: 2-player co-op multiplayer with both players managing one Dungeon together.

Pummel the enemy by choosing the most appropriate form of attack for the situation. \r\nPlayers will be challenged by dozens of distinct types of enemies, each with their own weapons and attacks, all working together to bring the player down.

The stark contrast between furry animals and sterile mechanical soldiers introduce the theme of conflict in the game story. \r\nThe realistic 3D visuals powered by Unreal Engine 4 combined with Physically-Based Rendering take the Action Platformer genre to a whole new level of graphics quality."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"f.i.s.t.-forged-in-shadow-torch","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52501.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.c4e8a5c6-16be-42e1-8ab4-3dd248750581","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":false,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11328.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.1b18322f-e441-4982-bc93-244dc075964e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16573.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.11683921-9caf-4f62-a7c8-0b3343e3f98b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12785.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.11e856bc-236c-4999-a0c9-05ae2ca46036","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55429.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.bde350f0-b3dd-485a-9d92-de32aeafc633","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2965.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.9c1a60cb-594c-41be-ad4f-98f55d03db8f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3941.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.c8027e71-a64f-4eb0-be90-1c455825fd8e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19368.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.f37c278c-ea22-46e0-8966-417b2f230b09","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53547.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.6ac996d5-19ee-4b1c-a025-c4b3f017899e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3768.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.bc0a3eba-3de1-470c-b85b-7d089f290634","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18867.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.e5955839-ae66-44cb-9f61-4e77b9089a5e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44969.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.d1e7595c-5a1c-48fd-8e2d-1f3ef6af462c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28930.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.25f47c65-2da1-41a6-bd47-a79c41a3dd66","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51444.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.a7cf3da1-0549-4411-994a-8a0dc28b78b1","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58141.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.ffcd9340-6f64-4035-bdce-ad77f0e31a8b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55440.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.14372f89-25cd-4cf0-be3f-380e3a237cd9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46976.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.426d3e81-b8a7-402d-9c1f-ff079299518e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62201.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.2794f885-137e-44c4-adb4-743a4f7ecca9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13019.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.ba9e6109-175d-462d-a064-934e81cb5eda","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25070.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.91465394-cc5f-4fca-aae9-935aae32e42c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52693.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.56bc4942-a88b-4725-8641-273595221cff"],"ReleaseDate":5249920226427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":22277074944},"MetacriticPlatform":null,"AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Racing & flying","Simulation","Sports"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/f1-22/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":81},"ID":"9NLG03K3M699","Title":{"en":"F1® 22"},"Description":{"en":"Enter the new era of Formula 1® in EA SPORTS™ F1® 22, the official videogame of the 2022 FIA Formula One World Championship™.

Your first planet is where you’ll learn to survive, but that’s just the start. Build your very own starship and use it to colonise new worlds.

Strap on your handcrafted laser rifle and venture out into the unknown to explore dungeons, procedural bases, NPC stores and much more.\r\n\r\nDefend what you’ve built, or take on the galaxy. Defend your colony with fast-paced combat that utilizes physics like bullet drop, projectile speed and spread. Thwart enemy raids on your base with your stock of handcrafted grenades. Tired of just defending? Lay waste to enemy bases with destructible terrain as you wield everything from rusty old carbines to nuke launchers and energy weapons that harness the power of lightning!\r\n\r\nDevelop and construct advanced bases for protection.

Watch out, though: the bigger your colony gets, the more of a target it becomes for raiders (and jealous friends).\r\n\r\nAutomate work and train up a team. Even out here, you’re not alone. Save AI survivors and build a colony together. A range of unique stats, perks and flaws mean every colonist has something different to contribute. As your AI colonists complete tasks they’ll level up and get smarter, stronger and faster. Best of all, you can assign tasks and orders to NPCs to do the grunt work for you and prioritize their roles based on those skills.

Some nay-sayers have called the magnifying glass \"useless\", but what do they know?\r\n\r\nIn Case 1, The Haunted Island, a sloth has been haunted for weeks by a mysterious ghost that nobody can seem to track down. Even after hiring a team of ghost scientists, the mystery is no closer to being solved. Luckily for this tropical sloth, and unluckily for this pesky ghost, Frog Detective is here to crack the case! The Haunted Island is the first in this award-winning series, and this bite-sized mystery is what started an international cult obsession with the world of Frog Detective.\r\n\r\nIn the second mystery, The Case of the Invisible Wizard, we follow the Detective to Warlock Woods, where a celebratory parade for their newest neighbor has been maliciously destroyed. Now the neighbor is nowhere to be seen, and the town is in ruin. Can Frog Detective get to the bottom of things? We sure hope so, otherwise the game would be a bummer.\r\n\r\nIn the exciting series finale, Corruption at Cowboy County, The Detective and Lobster Cop are tasked to solve the conundrum of a sheriff-less town. But not all is as it seems here, when a surprisingly simple solution to the case reveals a sinister scheme. Maybe crime is real after all...\r\nThis final mystery is jam-packed with twists and turns, a true love letter to the Frog Detective fans.\r\n\r\nFrog Detective: The Entire Mystery is a family-friendly yet witty take on the detective game genre. Solve the mysteries on your own, or play along with friends as you take turns reading out the dialogue.

Enough sweet talk, grab your gear, we need you and your squad to defeat the pink pests!\r\n \r\nYOUR MISSION: Liberate Earth from the Alien horde!\r\n\r\nHORDE MODE\r\nWe have an emergency on our hands! Resistance is a high-energy “Horde Mode” where you and your (extremely qualified) team will be deployed into unique locations, completing objectives, while surviving waves of pink life forms that increase in difficulty. It’s down to you to save the world. \r\n \r\nCollect Tokens to unlock weapons, items, and perks to boost your stats and build the ultimate loadout based on your playstyle. Complete formidable missions and extract with your squad to gain well-earned experience to level up your character. Additionally, for those that love to flaunt, you can show off your skill to other players in the session with 26 different ranks to work towards! Get out there and make us proud, recruit! \r\n \r\nSTORY MODE\r\nIt’s time to save the world! Embark on a journey to meet fellow earthlings that require your assistance, you virtuoso. You’ll be completing a wide range of exciting missions, usually, through chaotic combat, and yes, you have full permission to destroy everything in your path. \r\n \r\nMISSION TIP #1: Squad Up!\r\nWhile you can play From Space solo (if you're brave enough) you'd be wise to invite some friends to help you out. With online play you can create a four-person squad. Look, there's a lot of those pink pests out there so the more people, the better. Oh, and with a squad, you'll have some witnessess to tell everyone how awesome you are. It's basically a win-win scenario.\r\n \r\nMISSION TIP #2: Shoot, Explode & Stab\r\nWith a variety of weapons (Rocket Launchers, Miniguns, Flamethrowers and more!) there’s no excuse not to annihilate those aliens! Build your ideal spec and use tactical items such as grenades and mines, or slow down the hordes with barbed wire and machinegun turrets. Remember to scavenge the world for loot, you'll need it!\r\n\r\nMISSION TIP #3: You’re special, so pick your specialist skill!\r\nNo matter what type of player you are, there’s a wide range of characters in From Space's roster, each with their own unique ability and weapons. Find the perfect balance with your friends as you build the ultimate super squad.\r\n \r\nMISSION TIP #4: Don’t just stand there, Level-up!\r\nAs you level-up, you’ll be able to attach special perks to your character, helping you to master the art of destroying aliens. You'll need to find ways to combat increasingly more powerful aliens, and perks will help you accomplish all of your pink alien squashing dreams. Need to rethink your strategy? No problem! We like innovators!

As the leader of possibly the last civilized society on Earth, you’re going to build the city your survivors live in, discover new technologies, explore frozen wastelands and most importantly, manage and rule society to prepare it for life in an unforgiving world. Whether you’re an enlightened ruler or an iron-fisted tyrant, you’ll discover choices in this world aren’t as easy as they seem, and that holding power over people has a cost as heavy as the responsibility you feel in caring for them.\r\n\r\nSHAPE YOUR SOCIETY\r\nEstablish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. \r\n\r\nShould you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless.\r\n\r\nEXPAND AND EXPLORE\r\nSurvival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills.\r\n\r\nWhile New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.\r\n"},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"frostpunk","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60016.14372914980969275.d331a64f-b3f1-4a83-91cf-cb9cce9ce027.2a30409a-59be-488d-9ccb-822b8974b208","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5248287770427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":9621059778},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Role playing"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/fuga-melodies-of-steel-2/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":86},"ID":"9P5CK72457WF","Title":{"en":"Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2"},"Description":{"en":"A year has passed since the events of Fuga: Melodies of Steel.

Inspired by timeless classic ARPG's such as Diablo 2 and Titan Quest, Ghostlore features a detailed item and character customization system, procedurally generated maps, and authentic 90's retro graphics.\n\nLORE COMES TO LIFE\nThe bloodthirsty Penanggal is a gruesome creature with origins in Malay folklore. It comprises of nothing more than a disembodied head and dangling entrails. The Indonesian Babi Ngepet myth tells of sorcerors who sacrifice their humanity in order to become boar demons. The tales of Hungry Ghosts are superstitions brought over by Chinese immigrants - undead horrors cursed to remain forever hungry due to their greed in mortal life.\n\nStories from the maritime region of Southeast-Asia are full of all manner of nightmarish, horrifying creatures. Are you brave enough to face them? Discover over 40 different enemies, each with their quirks and tactics to defeat based on their descriptions in folklore.\n\nA WORLD LIKE NO OTHER\nExplore a procedurally generated world that takes inspiration from the developers' home country of Singapore, its two closest neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia, and the rest of Southeast Asia.\n\nPlayers unfamiliar with the region will get to experience a culture that is underrepresented and rarely seen in other forms of media. Players who live in Southeast Asia will find plenty of things they recognize - such as the food! Collect and prepare various meals to boost your stats. Don't fight on an empty stomach!\n\nMULTI CLASS SYSTEM\nGhostlore allows you to mix-and-match abilities from 3 out of 6 character classes to create your own unique hero. The 6 classes are:\n• The Adept: Mystic warriors skilled in Martial Arts, honing their mind as well as their body.\n• The Exorcist: Able to sense the spirit world with ESP and cast out evil spirits.\n• The Feral: Fearless fighters bestowed with the power of blood magic and the ability to transform into a Weretiger.\n• The Geomancer: Masters of the art of bending the elemental forces of Earth, Fire, Ice and Lightning to their will.\n• The Hashashin: Shadowy assassins who rely on speed and stealth to take down opponents.\n• The Sentinel: Keepers of the forest with the ability to communicate with animals.\n\nBUILD YOUR OWN SKILL TREES WITH THE SKILL LINK SYSTEM\nEach class comes with a “skill set”, a pool containing active skills, skill modifiers, and passive class bonuses. Skills must be assigned to a grid in order to be usable. More grid spaces unlock as you level up. Things can be placed in or taken out of the grid at will.\n\nSkill modifiers can be used to change the characteristics of any active skill from any class. Skill modifiers link together with active skills both across and down. (see green highlighted area in image). Some skill modifiers have tradeoffs.\n\nSome skill modifiers are trigger modifiers. Trigger modifiers allow a skill to be used automatically, as long as there is enough MP, the skill is not on cooldown, and the modifier’s specified conditions are met.\n\nCOMBO SKILLS\nEach active skill is also able to combine with skills from other classes to form an advanced skill that incorporates the characteristics of both base skills. Combo skills are created when two compatible skills are placed adjacent to one another in the skill grid.\n\nGLYPH SYSTEM\nThe Glyph system is where Ghostlore brings something truly new to the Action-RPG table. In your travels you will find Glyphs - magical symbols that you can inscribe onto your body to gain new powers.Each Glyph takes up space on your body (represented in game as a grid). As your level increases, so do the number of glyphs you can inscribe onto yourself.Here's where things get interesting: Compound glyphs are rare and special glyphs that use 5 normal glyph spaces, but grant additional bonuses to glyphs that are placed within their configuration. Plan your Compound Glyph layout in order to maximise stat bonuses!In Ghostlore, you can wield a variety of weapons prevalent in Southeast-Asian martial arts:• The Kris or Keris - a blade with a distinctively wavy shape. It is a well-balanced weapon.\n• The Bow and Arrow has been a staple of hunting since the dawn of time; apparently they come in handy with ghost-hunting as well!\n• Parangs, also known as machetes, are cleaving blades with a wide arc.\n• The deadly Kukri knives are the fastest attacking melee weapons in the game.\n• The trusty Spear has the longest reach out of all the melee weapons.\n• Finally, there are enchanted Talismans that can fly and give foes nasty papercuts.\n\nIn addition, you can find and equip a variety of Amulets. Amulets are commonly sold in many parts of real world Southeast Asia as good luck charms. In the world of Ghostlore, their power is very, very real. Equipping the right Amulet for the situation can mean the difference between a glorious victory and an untimely demise.Additionally, items can be modified in a couple of unique ways:\n\nSpirits inhabiting items are the reason why some of them have magical properties. Visit the Psychic to awaken the spirits which lay dormant in items such as weapons, shields, hats, scarves and amulets. Once awakened, the spirit will ask you to settle a score. Upon fulfilment of the request, your item will strengthen with new enchantments.Based on actual Southeast Asian folklore, the Orang Bunian are nature spirits that you can meet in your travels. On rare occasion, they will bless your items with new, random properties.\n\nNEVER FIGHT ALONE\n• Local co-op multiplier lets you play with up to 4 of your friends on the same screen.\n• Modding support allows you to customise your experience with mods from the community.\n• The Shrine of Balance is an optional asynchronous multiplayer feature which lets you help other players by sending them equipment. You have better chances of good loot in return when they use your equipment.\n• The Shrine of Spirits is another optional asynchronous online multiplayer mechanic where a 'snapshot' of another player's current character (also known as their 'Ghost Data') can be temporarily summoned into the your own game as an ally NPC.\n\nENDLESS CHALLENGES\nMission Mode: Undertake randomized missions after completing the campaign. Unlock Map Data, which allows you to modify missions and change the odds more to your favour.

You no longer have to fantasize about being a goat, your dreams have finally come true! \r\n\r\nGameplay-wise, Goat Simulator is all about causing as much destruction as you possibly can as a goat. It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. Destroy things with style, such as doing a backflip while headbutting a bucket through a window, and you'll earn even more points! When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\nGoat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n• You can be a goat \r\n• Get points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends that you're the alpha goat \r\n• MILLIONS OF BUGS! We're only eliminating the crash-bugs, everything else is hilarious and we're keeping it \r\n• In-game physics that bug out all the time \r\n• Seriously look at that goat's neck \r\n• You can be a goat"},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"goat-simulator","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57187.13882037073203566.da1afb62-bb11-43df-b6aa-9b0deb8f35d9.9dc5c212-78c7-439e-abe0-53a972b77cda","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.647.13882037073203566.da1afb62-bb11-43df-b6aa-9b0deb8f35d9.ca86a65d-325a-4780-9a16-4ecd564b6591","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59785.13882037073203566.da1afb62-bb11-43df-b6aa-9b0deb8f35d9.6efa73fb-61ad-4dcd-aecc-d79e6bbb95fc","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37942.13882037073203566.da1afb62-bb11-43df-b6aa-9b0deb8f35d9.3ea5c2d6-19c6-4bf7-a77e-af0b970d27a0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38783.13882037073203566.da1afb62-bb11-43df-b6aa-9b0deb8f35d9.49fc1cd9-00c5-48ad-ac00-b8bfddbb0134","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43618.13882037073203566.da1afb62-bb11-43df-b6aa-9b0deb8f35d9.61b7186b-8eb2-4add-be15-220759bcae09","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49933.13882037073203566.da1afb62-bb11-43df-b6aa-9b0deb8f35d9.67886b8f-dd57-47ef-8974-5a568a8f62e8","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18894.13882037073203566.da1afb62-bb11-43df-b6aa-9b0deb8f35d9.48926a7c-b68b-4c3e-9903-c1cc299b7d40","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17605.13882037073203566.da1afb62-bb11-43df-b6aa-9b0deb8f35d9.c3136ff0-40c8-418a-b69c-d779aef01419","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28595.13882037073203566.da1afb62-bb11-43df-b6aa-9b0deb8f35d9.b5a41848-3f93-49ad-814b-55e763322edd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52810.13882037073203566.da1afb62-bb11-43df-b6aa-9b0deb8f35d9.fa24636a-6ec6-4d9e-81f5-cb242d2cd8c6"],"ReleaseDate":5248446242427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":1945789365},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Family & kids","Sports"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/golf-with-your-friends/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-one"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":68},"ID":"9MVK5W0HMRP7","Title":{"en":"Golf With Your Friends (Windows Version)"},"Description":{"en":"Why have friends if not to play Golf...

It may or may not change over time or release as a final product. Purchase only if you are comfortable with the current state of the unfinished game. \r\n\r\nInkulinati is an ink-based strategy game straight from medieval manuscripts, where a rabbit’s bum can be deadlier than a dog's sword.\r\n\r\nTake your turn in Inkulinati duels filled with unexpected tactical depth (and humour!). Embark on an ever-changing journey, build your own bestiary, defeat medieval superstars and collect perks to unleash special powers.\r\n\r\nBecome a master of the Living Ink, grab your quill and build your unique strategy time after time so that you can be named the greatest Inkulinati of all time!\r\n\r\nINKULINATI IS INSPIRED BY REAL-LIFE MEDIEVAL MARGINALIA\r\n700 years in the making, finally these bizarre art pieces can come alive in a video game and show that medieval people also had their “memes” and that they laughed from the same silly things that we do today. You’ll see sword-wielding rabbits, dogs with spears, trumpets lodged in bottoms, human-eating snails, and more. Much, much more…\r\n\r\nFIGHT LIKE AN INKULINATI\r\nInkulinati are a legendary group who battle one another on the pages of medieval manuscripts. They fight by drawing Beasts with the Living Ink. Thanks to this magical substance, those creatures come to life and an epic battle ensues.Move your Beasts across the battlefield, perform actions on or with them, make tactical use of obstacles and collect more Living Ink to draw new Beasts which allows you to gain an advantage over your opponent.\r\n\r\nMULTIPLE DEADLY (AND BIZARRE) BEASTS TO UNLOCK\r\nDonkeys playing trumpets with their bottoms, bishop cats vanquishing heretics with prayers, heavy but deadly snails that eat units alive, and more. Much, much more. They all have their special skills and are waiting for your command.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL, BATTLE TIDE-TURNING ACTIONS PERFORMED BY THE INKULINATI\r\nIt’s not just your Beasts that can cause havoc and damage. Use your fists to smash your opponent's units, draw obstacles to create barriers, relocate your units with a move of your finger, or explode your troops to create pure, pure chaos. Just remember - your opponent can do it too.\r\n\r\nADAPT YOUR TACTIC TO EVERY BATTLE\r\nEach Inkulinati has its own army, with different Beasts, who in turn, have different abilities, strengths, and unfortunately, weaknesses (or fortunately - depending which side you’re on). But it’s not just the armies that can influence who will win any given duel. Each Battlefield is its own domain, with its own particular dangers that you should watch out for, and opportunities that you can use. You will have to use your wits and adapt your strategy to beat the opposing Inkulinati’s army on each specific Battlefield.\r\n\r\nA SINGLE-PLAYER CAMPAIGN\r\nUncover the mystery and secrets of Inkulinati and face such opponents as Death, Dante Alighieri, and more. Go out into the world and start your adventure! Fight the biggest Inkulinati masters in the land, tame the untamed Beasts, build your ultimate army, try to bring back your Master from the clutches of death, and most importantly, finish your grand quest with the biggest party that the middle ages have ever seen! Howza!!!\r\n\r\nCREATE AND DEVELOP YOUR OWN CHARACTER\r\nAs any aspiring Inkulinati Master, you will get to create your own Tiny-Inkulinati. During your journey you will learn the secret techniques of drawing new Beasts and Inkulinati Hand Actions, allowing you to choose the composition of your army. You can be a brave knight that has no fear and will send his loyal troops straight at his opponents. Or perhaps you would like to play with a bit more tact? In that case, you can be a nun who with the power of prayer can confuse her enemies and heal thy own servants. Those styles, and more, are waiting to be discovered and made your own. Express yourself!\r\n\r\nEVERY BATTLE HAS ITS OWN STORY\r\nTo mark every battle in history books for all future generations to see, a procedurally generated text describes the dramatic (or hilarious) events in detail just above the battlefield."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"inkulinati-game-preview","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43713.14571252009478417.26bd2413-8bd8-4320-bf6d-19e2e0cfaed4.19f8641d-a9b5-4b76-8df8-c6132fe52cea","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":false,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31718.13587470145765181.4b4bde28-545a-4c6f-98de-872092843767.81e68afc-fa6d-443f-acb9-5d6858b95bb5","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30519.13587470145765181.4b4bde28-545a-4c6f-98de-872092843767.61fe4bd2-778d-453a-9420-5ba13dce177b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55615.13587470145765181.4b4bde28-545a-4c6f-98de-872092843767.2e3786dc-38a0-42a3-b952-fd5896e9fe8d","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61244.13587470145765181.4b4bde28-545a-4c6f-98de-872092843767.bf5dee90-48eb-4501-9c96-d4a7008a886a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48852.13587470145765181.4b4bde28-545a-4c6f-98de-872092843767.acff9e6e-e0e1-4bb7-a3e9-3ca9e914602c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32599.13587470145765181.4b4bde28-545a-4c6f-98de-872092843767.a3a7aff7-3b8e-4e7b-bcd3-448acd8dae66","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18264.13587470145765181.4b4bde28-545a-4c6f-98de-872092843767.f6c39ba3-6c17-4080-b091-ff8199a00247","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52530.13587470145765181.4b4bde28-545a-4c6f-98de-872092843767.03870564-4d0d-4b95-a627-5f70ebc34df6","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6065.13587470145765181.4b4bde28-545a-4c6f-98de-872092843767.a0dd36e2-3b27-497f-9dbb-9b69ba225c6f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29186.13587470145765181.4b4bde28-545a-4c6f-98de-872092843767.7771a16e-711b-46ca-8f42-659dd802a42f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42757.14571252009478417.26bd2413-8bd8-4320-bf6d-19e2e0cfaed4.4263e298-e6e0-4a58-9417-0f8f447b9677","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.65479.14571252009478417.26bd2413-8bd8-4320-bf6d-19e2e0cfaed4.453293a2-12a8-4bbe-a030-51b00fb137ab"],"ReleaseDate":5249767046427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":3675045888},"MetacriticPlatform":null,"AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Platformer"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/inside/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":87},"ID":"C17GQF31D617","Title":{"en-us":"INSIDE"},"Description":{"en-us":"Discover Playdead's unique indie adventure game Inside, a dark, narrative-driven platformer combining intense action with challenging puzzles.

Choose from dozens of champion cards to include in your deck, each with a different mechanic inspired by their original League of Legends abilities.\r\nChampions enter the battle as powerful cards, and if you play smart, they level up to become even more epic. Level your champions multiple times in-game, and earn Champion Mastery crests the more you play.\r\n\r\nALWAYS A NEW WAY TO PLAY\r\nEvery champion and ally in the game comes from a region of Runeterra. You have access to cards from nine regions: Demacia, Noxus, Freljord, Piltover & Zaun, Ionia, Targon, Shurima, the Shadow Isles, and Bandle City.\r\nExplore how different champions and regions work together to give you unique advantages against your opponents. Combine, adapt, and experiment with frequent new releases in an always-evolving meta.\r\n\r\nCHOOSE YOUR PATH\r\nIn PvE, each choice you make shapes your journey. React to unique encounters, earn and equip power-ups, unlock new champions, and rise to new challenges as you move across the map. The enemies will get stronger, but so will you—and you’ll discover different endings the more you play.\r\n\r\nPLAY TO WIN, NOT PAY TO WIN\r\nEarn cards for free, or buy exactly what you want with shards and wildcards—you’re in control of your collection, and you’ll never pay for random packs of cards. While there’s always the option to purchase specific champions, you can easily complete your collection without spending a cent.\r\nVictory or defeat, each battle brings experience and progress. Choose which region you explore first and unlock the cards that call to you, changing regions as often as you like. As you advance, you’ll collect new allies, spells, and champions.\r\nOnce a week, you’ll also unlock chests from the Vault. These chests level up the more you play, increasing the rarity of cards inside from common all the way up to champion. They can also contain wildcards, which can be turned into any card you want—no guessing required.\r\n\r\nCLIMB THE RANKS\r\nAt the end of every season, 1024 qualifying Ranked players on each of LoR’s four regional shards (Americas, Asia, Europe, and Southeast Asia) will be able to compete for pride, glory, and a cash prize in the seasonal tournament.\r\nBut Ranked play isn’t the only way to qualify—you can also run the Last Chance Gauntlet.

Tough winters and unexpected events challenge your skills and dexterity as you strive to build your own legacy.\r\n\r\nYou can choose to follow the main chapters, solve the questlines or just roam around and explore the vast medieval world – but be careful as wolves or bears may try to take a bite from you...\r\nBegin with the simplest things for your own survival like hunting and farming as well as building yourself a home.

Among moves that can be unlocked, there are moves that are new to the series, such as \"Cicada Surge\", which allows you to dodge any enemy attack, \"Meditation\", which allows you to consume your Ki gauge to recover health, and more.\r\n\r\nNote: This product is included in \"NINJA GAIDEN: Master Collection\", and \"NINJA GAIDEN: Master Collection Deluxe Edition\".

Ripped from their peaceful retirement to rejoin the criminal world by a new threat, one born from the chaos the Crew left in their wake.\r\n\r\nIn order to identify and crush this new threat, the Crew is leaving their Washington DC roots behind them and moving to New York City. A new location will bring with it new challenges, but also new opportunities for a heister with a plan.\r\n\r\nGive in to your greed\r\n\r\nGive outlet to your greed and let loose in PAYDAY 3. In addition to gold, cash and jewelry and any other valuables they might come across, you’ll be able to build a sizable collection of weapons, cosmetics and accolades.\r\n\r\nIt won’t be as simple as showing up and gaining goodies. You’ll have to work hard and plan smart to get away with as much loot as possible. Gain experience, unlock new skills and gain proficiency in weapons to steadily grow your power to handle the tougher challenges.\r\n\r\nThe Art of Heisting\r\n\r\nA professional heister knows it takes planning, hard work and a good amount of luck in order to execute a successful heist. In PAYDAY 3 the choice is put in the hands of the players, deciding how to tackle the heist, whether you sneak or go in guns blazing, whether you let your hostages go or keep them around as pawns, whether you go at it alone or bring friends. The choices are endless and in your hands, they will vastly change how the game plays.\r\n\r\nThrive in Co-op\r\n\r\nNot just anyone is worthy of standing at your side for something as important as a heist. Likewise, PAYDAY 3 is best enjoyed with close friends in mind, whether you bring them from your childhood or make them along the road.\r\n\r\nThe PAYDAY-series has always valued the bonds made through hardship and tries to reflect that in the actions and words of our heisters while in the game, and through our community while on the outside.\r\n\r\nAccount with Starbreeze Nebula required to play PAYDAY 3."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"payday-3","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":0,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41648.13779457877292855.4803a4b4-94cc-4b12-bf91-ad49bcb0c65c.f14df05b-5717-4af8-a8ab-6201e4159608","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54257.13779457877292855.4803a4b4-94cc-4b12-bf91-ad49bcb0c65c.0c055b53-1d9a-4f03-b4fc-dd316467a5af","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36413.13779457877292855.4803a4b4-94cc-4b12-bf91-ad49bcb0c65c.38b89a08-f322-4890-87f9-8997b485836a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61289.13779457877292855.4803a4b4-94cc-4b12-bf91-ad49bcb0c65c.9dd7499c-c4cd-4d65-8289-ec45686bbd17","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42482.13779457877292855.4803a4b4-94cc-4b12-bf91-ad49bcb0c65c.f5958f4e-ee58-4814-a63c-8b4aec3e4a77"],"ReleaseDate":5249995070427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":28273455104},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Puzzle & trivia"],"MetacriticUrls":{"Xbox360":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/peggle/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-360"},"MetaScore":{"Xbox360":89},"ID":"9MVPD3Z5N4QL","Title":{"en":"Peggle®"},"Description":{"en":"Want to be a Peggle Master?

It may or may not change over time or release as a final product. Purchase only if you are comfortable with the current state of the unfinished game.\r\n\r\nPhantom Abyss is a massive asynchronous multiplayer game that casts players into procedurally-generated temples and tasks them with retrieving the sacred relics hidden within deadly chambers. Intrepid adventurers will dodge scores of hidden traps, leap treacherous chasms, and flee relentless guardians through branching paths until one of the relics are claimed or the devices of death overwhelm them. Be warned, you only get one attempt at each temple and failure or settling for a lesser relic means you will never see that temple again...\r\n\r\nThe cleverest players will use the phantom runs of failed attempts from other players to their advantage and avoid the missteps and mistakes that led to their doom. Once the legendary relic at the bottom of each temple is found, the temple goes away forever and becomes the priceless trophy of the skilled adventurer.\r\n\r\nAsynchronous Multiplayer\r\nExplore the perilous halls and colossal rooms of each temple alongside the phantoms of fallen players that came before you. Use their successes and failures to your advantage to progress deeper than they ever could have hoped.\r\n\r\nUnlock More Treacherous Floors\r\nRecover keys from chests to unlock deeper, deadlier sections of the temple that house more coveted relics. The more difficult a relic is to obtain, the greater the reward - the final Legendary Relic of a temple allows you to claim the whole temple so that it's gone forever.\r\n\r\nBlessings from the Gods\r\nAs adventurers venture further into a temple, offerings of collected treasures can be made at altars to gain a new blessing for the rest of the run. Collect as much treasure as you can to please the gods and gain a double jump, glide jump, extended slide, damage protection, and more!\r\n\r\nUnlockable Whips\r\nUnlock new whips with success and choose from your collection before venturing into your next run. Each whips carries a minor blessing but also a curse that may complicate your attempt at riches and glory.\r\n\r\nFull details on the latest status of the game, how you can give feedback and report issues can be found at https://www.phantomabyss.com/"},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"phantom-abyss-game-preview","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56545.13633827486627594.07290a41-f96f-4e82-b3f2-145174a6351a.d48b6ff1-9c9a-4e1a-9a03-7c59d51483fb","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":false,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5249704226427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":2574901248},"MetacriticPlatform":null,"AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Classics","Role playing","Simulation","Strategy"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/phoenix-point/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":74},"ID":"9P1P5Q3BNM7J","Title":{"en":"Phoenix Point"},"Description":{"en":"Phoenix Point puts players in the midst of a desperate fight to take back the Earth from a mutating, alien menace. Featuring turn-based tactical combat on procedurally generated maps, and resource management on a global scale, Phoenix Point offers endless replayability and a brutal challenge.\r\n\r\nFollowing a global environmental disaster, the Pandoravirus appeared and began reshaping creatures, including humans, into hideous mutants. Unable to stop the progress of the virus, much of human civilization was wiped out -- only small enclaves remain, separated by their principles and the vast landscape. The Phoenix Project, an ancient failsafe against global catastrophe is the only hope to unite mankind and take back the planet.\r\n\r\nLead the Phoenix Project from its base at Phoenix Point. Research and develop new technologies and techniques, plan operations, build alliances to unite the planet-- or simply destroy your rivals. It's up to you to save the planet and rebuild civilization, but there may be much more to the alien threat than meets the eye.\r\n\r\n* Mutating Alien Menace: Face down an ever-changing alien threat that adapts to your tactics and offers no respite even as your team becomes more powerful and technologically advanced.\r\n\r\n* Uncover the Secrets of the Pandoravirus: Phoenix Point features a complex narrative, with multiple endings that the player can only uncover via multiple playthroughs. Discover a secret history, as you learn about the origins of the mutants, the Pandoravirus, and Phoenix Point itself through exploration, diplomacy, and research.\r\n\r\n* Manage Diplomatic Relations: The Phoenix Project is not the only organization trying to reclaim the Earth. The militaristic New Jericho, the mystical Disciples of Anu, and the technophiles of Synedrion all offer unique rewards for co-operation and threats for opposition. It is up to you to decide how, or even if, to deal with them.\r\n\r\n* Take Aim on the Battlefield: In addition to equipping and commanding units, Phoenix Point lets you take direct control of your soldier's shots in combat, with a unique free-aiming system. Target enemy weakspots, weapons, or valuables, or just go for center mass.\r\n\r\n* Next-Gen Tech with Classic Pedigree: Phoenix Point was designed by Julian Gollop, the creator of the X-COM series in the 1990s. Keeping the core ethos of X-COM while updating the visuals, technology, and systems to modern standards has made Phoenix Point best-in-class."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"phoenix-point","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23750.14507726714197033.ea391b48-d8cb-4724-a6cb-765168bd5161.0029c50b-c234-475e-9928-0185fc83e0aa","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27297.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.8f0d79d4-fb71-4169-bb64-0b77cac69f7f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3522.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.17680a69-6b0d-4293-a53c-6d16fe0035fd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39128.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.c1af4919-7997-458a-ae19-4b9cf83ecfaa","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63541.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.c3d3f2f0-5855-4872-bbdd-720b19605e27","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34869.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.dd0e9d28-4298-463e-98c1-032a9fa45f9c"],"ReleaseDate":5248809122427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":25358311424},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":80},"ID":"C4R4RB3SB1NN","Title":{"en-us":"Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy"},"Description":{"en-us":"The classic courtroom adventure series that has sold over 6.7 million copies worldwide is finally here.

Boil and stir. Add the base: water, oil, or… something else. Congrats on your first potion! Was it easy to learn? Now try mastering it!\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT AND INVENT NEW RECEPIES\r\nCarefully plan your route via the Alchemy Map to combine different effects. Be mindful of common sense: you won’t find a market for a poisonous healing potion… right? Or would you?\r\n\r\nSELL POTIONS\r\nEvery day customers will come to your store looking for solutions to their problems. You will face consequences depending on what you decide to sell them. Attract guilds, befriend notable figures (or feud with them), gain riches and influence - and one day, you may even decide the fate of the whole town.\r\n\r\nBUY INGREDIENTS OR GROW YOUR OWN\r\nEvery alchemist needs ingredients. You can buy them from traveling merchants: it can be pricey, but successful haggling may save you some coin. Or you can just grow your own!\r\n\r\nGET CREATIVE WITH CUSTOMIZING\r\nWant to give a special appearance to your best potions? Go ahead! Change bottle shape, label type, icon, and colors. You can even give it a custom name and label description.

The unsettling environment is a character itself.\r\n\r\nEvery location contains its own theme (story), puzzles and characters that are integral in creating a cohesive world.

This plays a big role in keeping the player in an even greater state of awareness throughout the whole game.

Magic has returned to the world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Technology merges with flesh and consciousness. Elves, trolls, orks and dwarves walk among us, while ruthless corporations bleed the world dry. You are a shadowrunner - a mercenary living on the fringes of society, in the shadows of massive corporate arcologies, surviving day-by-day on skill and instinct alone. When the powerful or the desperate need a job done, you get it done... by any means necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the urban sprawl of the Seattle metroplex, the search for a mysterious killer sets you on a trail that leads from the darkest slums to the city’s most powerful megacorps. You will need to tread carefully, enlist the aid of other runners, and master powerful forces of technology and magic in order to emerge from the shadows of Seattle unscathed.\r\n\r\nThe unique cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation over 30 years ago.

Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall.\r\n\r\nIt’s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge’s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the “Flux State” controls the city of Berlin. It’s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there’s no better place to earn a quick payday.\r\n\r\nNow, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return…\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\nA Classic, Story-Driven cRPG: Dragonfall hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG’s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development.

Those who rebel against the coalition take on a purely militant view, coming to the opinion that the only way to bring peace is by ultimately crushing all who oppose them - especially xenos.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in their history, the war creates a schism in the Advent Unity. The loyalists seek to continue their policy of revenge against the Traders, and to assimilate all others to the Unity’s influence. However, others amongst the Advent suspect that a corrupting influence from within has diverted the Unity from its proper destiny.\r\n\r\nThe divide created in the Vasari Empire is less pronounced, but just as severe to their people. With the Vasari now practically frantic to move on to new space, the loyalist faction abandons cooperation and decides to take the resources they need by any means necessary. Having accepted the need to work together, the rebel faction feels that their best chance for survival is to work with the other races and bring them along to flee the approaching enemy.\r\n\r\nTake the battle for galactic supremacy to its ultimate level in Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion – a standalone RT4X game that combines the tactics of real-time strategy with the depth of the 4X genre (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate)."},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3586.13947402644023850.2b520969-4963-4db1-8249-4b43ce5f244b.8348d7aa-5b66-484d-be31-7c635de4ccbe","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5249625602427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":4465926144},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Card & board","Role playing","Strategy"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/slay-the-spire/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":89},"ID":"9MZQR8317S3B","Title":{"en":"Slay The Spire"},"Description":{"en":"We fused card games and roguelikes together to make the best single player deckbuilder we could.

Fight your way across the most immersive maps yet, with many real-world locations captured in stunning detail, and an improved traversal system that lets you explore more of them than ever before.\r\nFrance, 1944 – As part of a covert US Rangers operation to weaken the Atlantikwall fortifications along the coast of Brittany, elite marksman Karl Fairburne makes contact with the French Resistance. Soon they uncover a secret Nazi project that threatens to end the war before the Allies can even invade Europe: Operation Kraken.\r\n\r\nEXPANSIVE CAMPAIGN\r\nMany real-world locations have been captured using photogrammetry to recreate a living, immersive environment, and multiple infiltration and extraction points and kill list targets provide a whole new perspective on each mission. Take on the Nazi plot solo or work with a partner, with improved co-op mechanics allowing you to share ammo and items, give orders and heal each other.\r\n\r\nADVANCED GUNPLAY PHYSICS AND TRAVERSAL\r\nUse ziplines, slide down slopes and shimmy along ledges to reach the perfect vantage point, or to sneak past a sharp-eyed lookout. Factor in rifle stock and barrel options along with gravity, wind and heart rate while you line up your sights on the target.\r\n\r\nHIGH CALIBRE CUSTOMISATION\r\nUse workbenches to customise and upgrade virtually every aspect of your weapon – change scopes, stocks, barrels, magazines and more. Rifles, secondaries and pistols all have a huge variety of options. On top of that you can select the ammo to suit your target, from armour-piercing right down to non-lethal.\r\n\r\nINVASION MODE – CAMPAIGN DROP IN PvP AND CO-OP\r\nInvade another player’s Campaign as an Axis sniper and engage in a deadly game of cat and mouse, providing a new dimension to the challenge as you stalk your prey. Alternatively, as Karl you can call for assistance and have a second sniper drop in to help you out of a tricky situation.\r\n\r\nTENSE ADVERSIAL MULTIPLAYER\r\nCustomise your character and loadout and earn XP, medals and ribbons as you take on intensely competitive 16 player battles that will really test your sharpshooting skills. If co-op’s more your style, you can team up with up to 3 other players against waves of enemies in Survival mode.\r\n\r\nENHANCED KILL CAM\r\nMore realistic and grisly than ever, the trademark X-ray kill cam returns, showing you the true destructive power of each shot. Bones deflect bullets unpredictably, ripping a new path through enemy bodies. SMGs and pistols can also trigger kill cams, including multiple shots in dramatic slow motion.\r\n"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"sniper-elite-5","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34732.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.d7d5968f-4e09-4b2b-aea5-ea36b059cec1","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6211.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.933990f6-2efb-402c-b356-0a6256808dc6","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44790.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.d343893e-b214-4c48-a6ec-9e91c5857981","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2551.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.72068546-cd69-44e2-bd9e-06597bf3156b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40463.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.b46a49fc-a3e6-461e-bef9-19716df95233","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39524.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.1d7a605d-51ad-4988-809f-e37986e430d0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22655.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.72fff174-717c-4b40-8672-d8c553e93ab9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51794.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.9449b6b4-d011-462b-a8a8-cd04cf890bee","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18234.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.918d17fd-7f13-4e22-858c-51a6a3217f45","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26546.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.d30a9588-c4f9-4220-9c10-89f2dab0241c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33660.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.f7433785-db79-48fb-aa7c-980c845f240d"],"ReleaseDate":5249577218427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":56918753280},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-series-x","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Simulation"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/snowrunner/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":82},"ID":"9NP6WL1XQDBW","Title":{"en":"SnowRunner (Windows 10)"},"Description":{"en":"Get ready for the next-generation off-road experience! \r\n\r\nSnowRunner puts you in the driver’s seat of powerful vehicles as you conquer extreme open environments with the most advanced terrain simulation ever.

Who the heck are you?! Can you see me? You CAN, can't you? You've drunk the Spirittea and now you can see me!! Look, we've got problems! This town is crawling with troublemaking spirits. They've become lost because humans have stopped worshipping, leaving offerings or even thinking about them anymore.\r\n\r\nThis is- well... used to be a nice town, but there have been some strange goings-on lately! You're going to find the spirits causing mayhem and fix their problems so they can become paying customers, and get to know the townspeople and explore the mountain to its fullest!\r\n\r\nHere's the stuff you'll want to get involved in:\r\n\r\n-Solving the spirit's problems - To remember themselves, they'll need anything from some spicy noodles to finding and digging up their lost treasures, so get your problem-solving hat on!\r\n-Making friends with the locals - The townspeople all have their own schedules, likes, dislikes and hobbies to take part in - from bug catching to karaoke, there's something for everyone!\r\n-Managing the bathhouse - You'll need to clean towels, chop wood to heat the baths and seat the spirits with their friends for the ultimate bathing experience.\r\n-Upgrading and decorating - The local shops can make a whole lot of cool furniture and help you fix up overgrown areas of the bathhouse. We should make it big and fancy enough to take on all the spirits!\r\n\r\nTHE BATHHOUSE\r\n\r\nThe bathhouse is an ancient spirit building hidden up in the mountain, and it's up to you to clean it up and fill it full of customers! Once the spirits are in the bathhouse, you'll need to clean towels, chop wood to heat the baths and seat the spirits with their friends for the ultimate bathing experience.

This narratively-driven single player game puts you in the role of a Jedi Padawan who narrowly escaped the purge of Order 66 following the events of Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith. On a quest to rebuild the Jedi Order, you must pick up the pieces of your shattered past to complete your training, develop new powerful Force abilities, and master the art of the iconic lightsaber - all while staying one step ahead of the Empire and its deadly Inquisitors. \r\n\r\nWhile mastering your abilities, players will engage in cinematically-charged lightsaber and Force combat designed to deliver the kind of intense STAR WARS lightsaber battles as seen in the films. Players will need to approach enemies strategically, sizing up strengths and weaknesses while cleverly utilizing your Jedi training to overcome your opponents and solve the mysteries that lay in your path. \r\n\r\nSTAR WARS fans will recognize iconic locations, weapons, gear, and enemies while also meeting a roster of fresh characters, locations, creatures, droids and adversaries new to STAR WARS. As part of this authentic STAR WARS story, fans will delve into a galaxy recently seized by the Empire.

Explore and overcome a wide range of challenges focused on combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. \r\n\r\n● The Galaxy Awaits - Ancient forests, windswept rock faces, and haunted jungles are all unique biomes you’ll explore in Jedi: Fallen Order, with the freedom to decide when and where you go next. As you unlock new powers and abilities, opportunities open up to re-traverse maps in new ways; leveraging the Force to augment the way you explore.

Turn a matchstick into the lever that opens a door or a torch that ignites an obstacle. Power mighty machines with the latest AAA battery technology, cross cracks the size of chasms, and walk (literally!) on the razor’s edge. \r\n\r\nA great place to dig in\r\nSix Inches Under is a content-packed standalone follow-up (and not quite a sequel) to the original Supraland, designed for everyone! You can delve straight in and have a blast without having played the original.\r\n\r\nMore Supraland to love\r\nIf you dug the original Supraland, you’ll discover tons more of the puzzle-solving, metroidvania-style exploration you loved—plus more skills, a novel new approach to combat, more optional activities, and an original new soundtrack.\r\n"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"supraland-six-inches-under","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45405.14633781494161168.84712a8b-b7f3-4acd-8238-f2ac188595c8.8bf1209a-f04e-46b6-b85b-560bee730e7d","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2761.14633781494161168.84712a8b-b7f3-4acd-8238-f2ac188595c8.9fc39cb8-f4e1-4b13-9fd7-48a7315f04df","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17813.14633781494161168.84712a8b-b7f3-4acd-8238-f2ac188595c8.0a861ab2-0cbd-4ed7-ac06-28c2fa0f62f7","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48729.14633781494161168.84712a8b-b7f3-4acd-8238-f2ac188595c8.dabee840-9403-465d-ad8d-00b025f7d65c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26828.14633781494161168.84712a8b-b7f3-4acd-8238-f2ac188595c8.d3c5788f-ebb9-467f-8709-f67f6d8ec6be","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.80.14633781494161168.84712a8b-b7f3-4acd-8238-f2ac188595c8.ca9a0ae0-3063-432d-aeb3-e95aab8ca769","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29267.14633781494161168.84712a8b-b7f3-4acd-8238-f2ac188595c8.7f137709-bc39-4c5f-b154-fa9f02669b1d"],"ReleaseDate":5249886278427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":2760294400},"MetacriticPlatform":null,"AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Role playing"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PS5":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/sword-and-fairy-together-forever/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5"},"MetaScore":{"PS5":73},"ID":"9P8JHB7V4T5M","Title":{"en":"Sword and Fairy: Together Forever"},"Description":{"en":"Enter a realm that blends ancient mythology with traditional oriental aesthetics in Sword and Fairy: Together Forever, the latest standalone entry in the nearly 27-year-old RPG franchise!

Fresh out of a three-year prison sentence, an older and weathered Kiryu comes to find out that his surrogate daughter, Haruka, has gone missing from the orphanage he looks after. The trail leads him to his old stomping grounds in Kamurocho, where he discovers that she has been struck by a car and now lies in a coma. To make matters worse, Kiryu learns that Haruka now has a son that he must look after. With baby in hand, Kiryu journeys to the seaside town of Onomichi, Hiroshima to unravel the truth about Haruka, her son, and a sinister secret that the Hiroshima yakuza are harboring.\r\n\r\nFrom the unparalleled realism of the new setting of Onomichi, a beautiful, sleepy port town in Hiroshima Prefecture, to the latest evolution of Kamurocho, the biggest red-light district in Tokyo, Yakuza 6 is the ultimate iteration the game's blend of gritty crime story, hyper-explosive combat, and all the vices and distractions those locales have to offer.\r\n\r\nEnter the “Dragon Engine” - Explore the world of Yakuza like never before. Yakuza 6 is the first current-gen Yakuza title that was developed from the ground up for the current-gen hardware, introducing the seedy Japanese underworld with detailed visuals, lifelike animations, a new physics engine, interactive storefronts, seamless transitions and more.\r\n\r\nExplore Kamurocho Reborn and the Scenic Views of Onomichi - The hypnotic lights, opportunistic inhabitants, and hedonistic distractions of Kamurocho look better than ever. Revamped minigames like karaoke, batting cages, darts, hostesses, and the SEGA arcade have been streamlined for maximum pleasure, and new additions like the RIZAP Gym, Cat Café, and Clan Creator are the purrfect distractions after a long night of bashing heads! But it’s also time to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life to play tourist in beautiful Onomichi. This tranquil coastal community is home to plenty of local activities like bar mingling, spearfishing (think action-packed rail shooter … with fish), and more!\r\n\r\nLet the Bodies Hit the Floor - Yakuza 6 Kiryu is a 100% certified badass, so that means he’s a battle-hardened veteran when it comes to the art of street fighting. Although he utilizes one fighting style this time around, you best believe Kiryu hits like a truck. Devastating combos and bone-breaking Heat Actions make a return, but now the Dragon of Dojima can fill up a meter to engage Extreme Heat Mode. When activated, Kiryu glows blue and unleashes heavy-damage combos with his fists or any “tool” that’s close at hand.\r\n\r\nFully Voiced Japanese Audio - For the first time in series history, every line and piece of dialogue is fully voiced in Japanese.
