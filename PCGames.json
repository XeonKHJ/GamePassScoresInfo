Safety, security, and secrecy are of the utmost importance… usually.\n\nAfter a catastrophic containment breach, your workplace has become a cosmic battle zone: anomalous entities are on the loose, enemies from other dimensions are invading via portals, and an arcane military sect - known as The Order - is targeting personnel and entities indiscriminately, aiming to seize artifacts and put an end to the chaos.\n\nContainment procedures have failed and help isn’t on the way. Stranded miles beneath the surface, it’s up to you and your fellow scientists to band together, plan your escape, and make this underground complex your new home - for now.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nAbiotic Factor brings a 90’s sci-fi twist and rich character progression to the multiplayer open world survival crafting genre. Up to 6 players can choose their PHDs, build their scientist, gear up, and explore a massive subterranean complex, filled with supernatural artifacts, transdimensional foes, and science experiments gone awry.\n\nSCIENCE MEETS VIOLENCE\nBetween alien threats hunting their next meal, trigger happy soldiers, and the world’s most advanced robotic security forces attacking personnel working overtime, there’s no shortage of danger. As a scientist, fighting isn’t your forte, so you’ll need to put your PHD to work to outwit your opponents: craft ingenious and outlandish tools, weapons and gear, from simple nets and wooden bats to laser-cannons and elaborate traps - everything your big science brain can muster!\n\nMAINTAIN A HEALTHY WORK LIFE BALANCE\nMake yourself at home - you’re here for the long haul. Scavenge resources from vacant offices and empty labs, raid vending machines, and steal company property to build a new base of operations as you explore the facility. When it’s time for a change of scenery, pack up your belongings and move them across the facility using handcarts, forklifts, SUVs, teleporters, and more.\n\nJOIN THE SCIENCE TEAM\nDon your lab coat and earn your PhD: from Plant Geneticist to Defense Analyst and Structural Engineer (and many, many more), each with its own advantages essential to survival. Combine traits and skills, then level up to earn perks and abilities with your fellow scientists to forge a formidable scientific force.\n\nSURVIVE TO SEE YOUR NEXT DAY OFF\nWorking at GATE may have been a dream job, but dying here wasn’t part of your five year plan. Explore this massive underground facility as well as many worlds beyond and take full advantage of the most advanced technology unknown to mankind in this interdimensional sci-fi adventure!"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"abiotic-factor","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":0,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19958.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.61a5398e-bac4-4f45-91d8-ef4de785728e","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46343.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.a61b52ee-06aa-4e0c-b602-a5bbf27c4558","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27039.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.942459a6-5023-44fc-9491-999e56ca3203","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2810.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.b7109e46-a3f0-4b85-a389-7c4e79c9137a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9454.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.90975c2d-2a2d-4662-9dea-a68492fa8fb6","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43055.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.7bd32c91-7bb7-43fe-b3b7-62366c6d11bb","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12394.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.6bb2a335-ff9c-4da6-a0e6-a9d9feecaad2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49557.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.26fad1dd-99b2-40b3-b0f9-2d237da4d783","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8091.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.d4a9bc3c-705e-4d6c-91a9-908c0edd95fa","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39463.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.8d3f76e2-aa69-4631-a27f-c2a38b4a3c39","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48340.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.8cdcb17f-5edb-425c-90ae-4d3ed029924a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46138.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.0a54a222-73fd-421c-ac45-81dd2aa84ca0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30584.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.5f794223-4ed3-4b4b-ba21-866bc8e07a7c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47983.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.291c13b9-9040-4393-ba46-4019d883ce95"],"ReleaseDate":5250573986427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":4761149440},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Strategy","Simulation"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/against-the-storm/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":91},"ID":"9NRLRJPV4HWL","Title":{"en":"Against the Storm"},"Description":{"en":"You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.\n\nThe wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.\n\nMANAGE A DIVERSE POPULATION OF VILLAGERS\nFoxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?\n\nCITY BUILDER MEETS ROGUELITE\nExperience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?\n\nNEVER THE SAME GAME TWICE\nWith hundreds of gameplay modifiers and five distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.\n\nBUILD AN ENDLESS NUMBER OF CITIES\nLaying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"against-the-storm","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56295.14385363172001343.ef67463b-a065-4ebb-ae31-992199a7c91f.5cf59ead-2745-4f4f-9f20-9527e1ed7dc1","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62034.14385363172001343.8ac80d03-7ab1-46e4-84e8-5e7cf29439c9.e7945829-914f-41f2-9fb3-f60c248d280b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44892.14385363172001343.8ac80d03-7ab1-46e4-84e8-5e7cf29439c9.2f97f844-0065-473d-9ea6-c02ec467f2dc","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36191.14385363172001343.8ac80d03-7ab1-46e4-84e8-5e7cf29439c9.1c8fe29f-d1c9-4e72-acd1-0626e614635f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41843.14385363172001343.8ac80d03-7ab1-46e4-84e8-5e7cf29439c9.4c084fe1-572d-4e1e-8205-a0d4aba69f1f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7268.14385363172001343.8ac80d03-7ab1-46e4-84e8-5e7cf29439c9.33c38314-01c3-4826-a5fb-1c8dbedb8219","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7512.14385363172001343.8ac80d03-7ab1-46e4-84e8-5e7cf29439c9.e73a541e-84ed-44a0-98ec-c9d0f34a3c06","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22005.14385363172001343.8ac80d03-7ab1-46e4-84e8-5e7cf29439c9.9d54b4b4-1b74-4bf3-ade7-31baeff0dcf4","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9701.14385363172001343.8ac80d03-7ab1-46e4-84e8-5e7cf29439c9.11852b57-262a-46bf-95bc-785395565ba6"],"ReleaseDate":5250062498427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":2807689216},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Strategy"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/age-of-empires-definitive-edition/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":69},"ID":"9NJWTJSVGVLJ","Title":{"en":"Age of Empires Definitive Edition"},"Description":{"en":"Age of Empires, the pivotal RTS that launched a 20-year legacy returns in definitive form for Windows 10 PCs.

You awake on a mysterious island, your senses overwhelmed by the blinding sunlight and brilliant colors bouncing off every surface around you, the azure waters of a verdant Island lapping at your bare feet. A deep roar echoes from the misty jungle, jolting you into action, and you stand up – not afraid, but intrigued. Are you ready to form a tribe, tame and breed hundreds of species of dinosaurs and other primeval creatures, explore, craft, build, and fight your way to the top of the food-chain? Your new world awaits… step through the looking-glass and join it!\n\nFEATURES\n\nARK: Survival Ascended has completely recreated and redesigned the artwork and worlds of ARK to take advantage of the latest in videogame technology, Unreal Engine 5, using high-end graphics features such as fully dynamic Global Illumination (“Lumen”), so that light bounces realistically off of surfaces and provides realistic reflections, and advanced mesh streaming (“Nanite”) of hundreds of millions of triangles for extreme detail.\n\nAdvanced new physics systems such as dynamic water so that every creature creates waves, ripples, splashes, and bubbles as they move through fluids, and fully interactive physical foliage where every blade of grass, bush, and tree reacts to characters, explosions, projectiles, and physics objects. Knock down a tree, and see it crash into other trees and disturb all the foliage on its way down to smacking into the grass below! Detect an enemy moving sneakily through the grass as it shifts and sways in response to their presence. Demolish a building and watch the pieces break apart realistically, interacting with the grass and water as they fall.\n\nARK: Survival Ascended includes access to all of ARK’s worlds, including Scorched Earth, Aberration, Extinction, ARK Genesis Part 1, ARK Genesis Part 2, and more. The Island, Scorched Earth, Aberration and The Center are released now, Extinction will be released on December 16, with the subsequent expansion worlds to be added at no additional cost on a regular basis.\n\nThe definitive survival experience returns better than ever: design your Survivor, form a tribe, and tame, train, breed & ride dinosaurs within a living ecosystem. Watch your food, water, temperature, and weather patterns. Slowly expand outwards as you harvest, build structures, farm crops, customize your visual designs, and proceed to explore to uncover the true nature of The Island and the worlds beyond. \n\nThorough Quality of Life revamps in every area: redesigned User Interfaces, dynamic navigation for intelligent creature pathfinding, Wild Babies, Photo Mode, new Camera systems, new Map system, Tracking System, new Structures and Items, new Creatures, and much more.\n\nCross-Platform Modding: Download & play new custom content created by players, including new maps, creatures, items, and game modes, through a dedicated mod collection directly within the game! Enjoy an endless stream of new ARK content as the creativity and talent of the community is fully unleashed for the first time ever across gaming platforms!\n\nCross-Platform Multiplayer: form your online tribe across different gaming platforms as you work together to survive and thrive on the ARK!\n\nSupports public online multiplayer for up to 70 players, private-session multiplayer for up to 8 players, and local split-screen for 2

It's up to you to decide how to deal with them - fight together against evil, invite them into your party or simply ignore them.\r\n\r\nSouls with a Twist\r\nAshen is faithful to the \"souls\" genre of stamina-based combat, introducing players to a punishing yet satisfyingly vast world. But here’s the twist - no two gameplay experiences are alike. Whether you’re exploring bogs, investigating a fjord or pillaging an old palace, where you are at any given moment will dramatically alter the course of your adventure. It's a brutal open world; you're just living in it.\r\n\r\nCreatures + Combat\r\nAshen has no shortage of dangerous encounters, from hostile enemies to indigenous creatures. You'll be rewarded for studying the environment and its inhabitants, planning your adventure rather than flying by the seat of your pants. The flora and fauna within the world aren't just fantastical; they're often fatal. Each confrontation, no matter how trivial, has potentially dire consequences.\r\n\r\nCrafting is Key\r\nAs you discover survivors, you'll have the choice to invite them to your Town. But these aren't mere adventurers - they're potential collaborators, bringing a plethora of crafting skills, from blacksmithing to foraging expertise, in tow.\r\n\r\nStory + Score\r\nFamed fantasy author Mark Lawrence (The Broken Empire trilogy) and renowned band Foreign Fields collaborated closely with the development team at Aurora44 to craft a cohesive and unique narrative and sound."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"ashen","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39596.67644652336133489.b3703282-21c5-4da4-9f47-ba53b33b37b5.569189bd-72c6-4e18-bae2-96f3542515b3","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23937.67644652336133489.b3703282-21c5-4da4-9f47-ba53b33b37b5.6942594f-c17c-410a-9d71-00ecff3baa23","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9983.67644652336133489.b3703282-21c5-4da4-9f47-ba53b33b37b5.d4bcadbe-e7f1-41d6-a73a-a8205ce9aae2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16775.67644652336133489.b3703282-21c5-4da4-9f47-ba53b33b37b5.a45d66f4-fbd1-4539-a839-adc6ac675f6b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28021.67644652336133489.b3703282-21c5-4da4-9f47-ba53b33b37b5.bf225274-44ef-4919-aebd-5ba99ed82378","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.188.67644652336133489.b3703282-21c5-4da4-9f47-ba53b33b37b5.20226d28-47ca-4877-b53e-016b15c938a9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20468.67644652336133489.b3703282-21c5-4da4-9f47-ba53b33b37b5.dca77d85-e5ed-423b-b5a5-a5df49f2aa0d"],"ReleaseDate":5248483394427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":7480389632},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Racing & flying","Simulation","Sports"],"MetacriticUrls":{},"MetaScore":{},"ID":"9NZQPT0MWTD0","Title":{"en-us":"Asphalt Legends"},"Description":{"en-us":"Spark your competitive soul with Asphalt Legends and feel the collective heartbeat of the road!

Will your explorative steps lead you to the rumored Room 46?\n\nDRAFTING YOUR JOURNEY  \nUpon reaching a closed door in Mt. Holly, you decide what room appears behind it and each decision shapes your path as you navigate through the manor. Every door can reveal new and exciting chambers that contain their own unique challenges and secrets. But be careful how you draft, for each day the manor’s floor plan resets and the rooms you saw today may not be the same rooms you see tomorrow.\n\nEVERY STEP COUNTS \nYour progress each day is shaped by the rooms you select to draft and the tools you find within them. Items in the game can be used in a number of creative ways to fuel your exploration deeper into the house, allowing you to adopt unique strategies to combat the challenges that each day brings. Yet, tread wisely – the house resets each dawn, erasing all but the permanent upgrades to your estate blueprint.

Design, build, and manage the city of your dreams, from public services to civic policies, and challenge yourself to grow from a simple town to a bustling metropolitan hub.\n\nCities: Skylines is an award-winning, best-selling management game, now available for Windows 10 with all of its robust city-simulation gameplay and unique charm along for the ride. The Windows 10 Edition includes the base game and the popular After Dark expansion, allowing players to plan and design for their cities’ nightlife and tourist attractions.\n\nMain Features:\n- Build the city of your dreams: Plan road networks, bus lines and parks. Bring on a smog-filled industrial revolution or create a quiet beach town ideal for tourists powered by renewable energy. Bring education, healthcare and safety to your citizens. Build it your way!\n\n- Multi-tiered and challenging simulation: Playing as the mayor of your city, you’ll be faced with balancing essential requirements such as education, water electricity, police, firefighting, healthcare and much more, along with your city’s economy. Citizens within your city react fluidly, keeping you on your toes with ever-evolving demands.\n\n- Extensive local traffic simulation: Managing traffic and the needs of your citizens to work and play will require the use of several interactive transport systems – use careful road planning alongside buses, trains, subways, and much more.\n\n- Districts and policies: Be more than just another city hall official! Create a car-free downtown area, assign free public transport to your waterfront, or ban pets in suburbia. Designate parts of your city as a district in order to set policy at the local level, and give different parts of town their own personalities.\n\n- After Dark included: Watch your city become an entirely different place at night: a day-night cycle will have your citizens seeking out places to unwind after work. Add in new policies and zones to create popular hotspots and provide enough taxis and trains to get to and from the clubs!\n\nParadox Account required for certain features of the game.

You are on the run from the corporation that made you and the gang that seeks to control you. Commandeer a ship, build a network of crew and allies, and take on challenging contracts as you seek to build a future for yourself.\n\nChoose a class, configure your skills and assemble your crew in unique tabletop-inspired gameplay. Your future depends on the roll of a dice, as you make difficult choices in a complex world. Reinventing the award-winning systems of Citizen Sleeper, this dice-driven RPG will satisfy both fans of the original game and new players alike.\n\nSTAY AHEAD OF YOUR PAST\nAfter a desperate attempt to free yourself from servitude by rewriting the very code that governs your system, you are on the run again, this time with a malfunctioning body, a price on your head and no memory of your past.\n\nREBOOT / REBUILD / REPAIR\nCitizen Sleeper’s revolutionary dice system returns, revised for the sequel. Manage your stress or take damage to your dice. Deal with glitches as they accrue in your system. Push yourself to get lucky and make this cycle count.\n\nPUSH YOUR LUCK\nEach character class now has a unique “Push” ability that can help you turn the tide of a difficult job or send you into a dangerous spiral depending on how and when you choose to use it. Reroll your dice to change your fate, or focus a single die to bet everything on a big success.\n\nNAVIGATE THE BELT\nChart a course from hub to hub with complete freedom, taking on jobs and setting goals as you see fit. A living world, the Starward Belt rewards curiosity and care, but it's up to you to decide which locations and stories deserve your time and resources.\n\nDO THE JOB, GET PAID\nContracts offer a new kind of focussed, tactical gameplay to the Citizen Sleeper experience. You’ll need to prepare carefully and choose the right approach for these multi-cycle, high-risk, high-reward jobs, but you’ll also have to react and adapt to both the roll of the dice and the twists and turns of each task.\n\nCHOOSE YOUR FUTURE\nPlayer choice is a massive part of the Citizen Sleeper experience, and the sequel deepens this with new skill checks that allow you to express your class and character in scenes, as well as branching storylines that will ask you to make hard choices.

Once you learn the cooking mechanics and start serving dishes, you’ll see yourself becoming a better chef with every new plate on the checkout.\r\n\r\nCareer mode is a culinary journey zero-to-hero style and your task is to gain fame for you and your restaurant. You’ll start from the basics and progressively unlock new more complex dishes and start serving more customers as your fame and experience grow. Once you master the recipes and workflow, you’ll be able to unlock various perks and skills.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you’re not interested in playing by the rules, you’re going to love the Sandbox mode. Access all the recipes and ingredients and prepare whatever you like without any pressure. You don’t even have to cook anything! Game physics gives you unlimited opportunities. Throw knives like darts, set up cutting boards like dominoes, set the whole kitchen on fire, blow up the oven and save the day using a fire extinguisher!\r\n\r\nLeaderboard Challenge. Ever wanted to prove that you are the best chef around? Well, now you can! Pick an order and take it to the kitchen. No distractions, just one simple goal – serve the best dish you can, as fast as you can. Based on this performance, the game will calculate your score and place you on a leaderboard (each recipe has its own). Become an expert at one dish or master them all!"},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"cooking-simulator","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61226.14318332024941603.bcd56dc7-63bc-4d56-bf05-e25c65cd0318.143a922e-35a6-4bdb-9d8b-3e53a7fca595","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5249644250427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":4997259264},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Role playing","Other","Family & kids"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/core-keeper/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":85},"ID":"9P7W9JLMHL04","Title":{"en":"Core Keeper"},"Description":{"en":"Awaken as an explorer in a long-forgotten cavern teeming with untold secrets.\r\nIn this award-winning, 1-8 player mining sandbox adventure, your choices shape an epic journey. \r\nHarvest relics and resources, craft advanced tools, build your base, and explore a dynamically evolving world waiting to be unearthed.\r\n\r\nLevel up your skills, defeat legendary Titans, and unveil the power of the Core.\r\nGrow your garden, fish in mysterious waters, master a vast array of recipes, raise and care for animals, encounter the Cavelings, and carve out your own unique world in an enchanting underground adventure.\r\n"},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"core-keeper","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35511.14104133814579619.9a04adba-39ea-4f1d-9e92-9f16849afc27.c0dcc951-2999-49c5-9ec7-0b04446b9f8b","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5250289478427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":709619712},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/crackdown-3/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":54},"ID":"9NXR6469DM2P","Title":{"en":"Crackdown 3"},"Description":{"en":"Time to step up your boom and stop crime as a super-powered Agent in Crackdown 3's open-world sandbox of mayhem and destruction.

Instilling joy and wonder, they provide a unique bond that enables you to utilize their skills for traversing the planet and solving environmental challenges. Once peaceful creatures, they now succumb to an unknown infection driving them to behave aggressively, which makes your mission to save them an urgent necessity.\n\nExploration-driven gameplay\nThe gameplay encourages curiosity-driven exploration of its distinct ecosystems—such as the colorful Nari jungle or mysterious Mâruba swamp—creating an interconnected world. With non-aggressive combat mechanics designed for healing rather than defeating and indigenous Flute melodies that you play to tame creatures, the game further highlights the creature-saver nature of the experience.\n\nMeaningful Narrative\nStep into the shoes of Vic, a 22-year-old nature adventurer as she navigates through the immersive expedition alongside Tabitha, a composed and astute researcher. Together, you confront the recurring infection—called “the withering” by the local race of Naam—threatening Ava’s inhabitants. The game's narrative, co-created by Rhianna Pratchett, is a journey of wonder and mystery but also discovery, leading to the revelation of the planet's captivating secrets.\n\nSaving Through Understanding\nCreatures of Ava is a game featuring a dense, populated world of rich ecosystems filled with creatures that play a vital role in the planet’s natural balance. It goes beyond traditional creature-related genres, offering a deeper understanding and connection with the things you’ll encounter on Ava. Once you come to understand the true meaning of the infection, you will be challenged to step out of the human-centric point of view and learn about the real toll it takes to preserve the primal beauty at the very roots of Ava.\n\nAfter all, can you save something you don't understand?\n"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"creatures-of-ava","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61939.14400608729854013.f3e97c2f-202d-48ee-b6f7-8667ef1177d0.468789fb-05d8-4f5f-a03c-e465f259932c","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61352.14400608729854013.def91861-1e56-4559-843c-07d1bf87a320.975ccfb0-33d0-495a-a2f9-80cc1aa96097","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61282.14400608729854013.def91861-1e56-4559-843c-07d1bf87a320.13a16845-3f20-48af-b53f-8c15da28b154","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29403.14400608729854013.6d870f3d-31e1-4c98-ba22-b1a07adac47d.0e93d8b2-3777-4dc5-a272-0c51804f83ad","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55526.14400608729854013.6d870f3d-31e1-4c98-ba22-b1a07adac47d.549bceae-c393-43d5-86df-8b91e52278fb","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48844.14400608729854013.6d870f3d-31e1-4c98-ba22-b1a07adac47d.8c4df159-ee2b-41d3-bf85-dd3a14d6cb33","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26800.14400608729854013.def91861-1e56-4559-843c-07d1bf87a320.ee0e5d01-2bc7-4ffd-936b-4d1b25dfa86f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20311.14400608729854013.6d870f3d-31e1-4c98-ba22-b1a07adac47d.0dab8a75-c18d-4815-a270-122b06837b2b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50683.14400608729854013.6d870f3d-31e1-4c98-ba22-b1a07adac47d.6836b76a-914e-48af-9b52-ea8edaa25840","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15602.14400608729854013.6d870f3d-31e1-4c98-ba22-b1a07adac47d.bc8353d6-9eac-4348-b859-95d72e16450b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25160.14400608729854013.6d870f3d-31e1-4c98-ba22-b1a07adac47d.f3f74cc0-a92f-4481-a191-6d7454cae739"],"ReleaseDate":5250272378427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":8482406400},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Sports"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PS5":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/cricket-24/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5"},"MetaScore":{"PS5":57},"ID":"9NKF2SZ630ZH","Title":{"en":"Cricket 24: The Official Game Of The Ashes"},"Description":{"en":"Cricket 24 is the culmination of a decade of Cricket video game development and includes teams from every corner of the globe.

Choose your noble house and lead your dynasty to greatness in a Middle Ages epic that spans generations. War is but one of many tools to establish your reign, as real strategy requires expert diplomatic skill, mastery of your realm, and true cunning. Crusader Kings III continues the popular series made by Paradox Development Studio, featuring the widely acclaimed marriage of immersive grand strategy and deep, dramatic medieval roleplaying. \n\n\nA bloodline begins\n  \n• Take command of your house and expand your dynasty through a meticulously researched Middle Ages. Begin in 867 or 1066 and claim lands, titles, and vassals to secure a realm worthy of your royal blood. Your death is only a footnote as your lineage continues with new playable heirs, either planned… or not. \n• Discover a sprawling simulated world teeming with peasants and knights, courtiers, spies, knaves and jesters, and secret love affairs. An extensive cast of historical characters can be romanced, betrayed, executed, or subtly influenced.  \n• Explore a vast medieval map stretching from the snowswept Nordic lands to the Horn of Africa, and the British Isles in the west to the exotic riches of Burma in the east. Claim, conquer, and rule thousands of unique counties, duchies, kingdoms, and empires. \n\n\nLarger than life \n\n• Each character is larger than life, with traits and lifestyle choices determining their actions and schemes. Prompt fear and dread as you rule with an iron fist, or inspire your subjects with magnanimous deeds. Genetics can be passed along to your children, be it the gift of genius or crippling stupidity. \n• Groom your heir with the appropriate guardians or educate them yourself. If found wanting, marry them off or despatch them through other means. \n• Customize your ruler and noble house, from appearance to attributes, and create a monarch worthy of all their inherited virtues and vices.\n\n\n\nReal strategy requires cunning\n\n• Govern an ever-evolving realm and grant titles to whom you see fit - or usurp your liege to claim their crown as your own. Be wary of rivals, from restless serfs to revengeful concubines. \n• The shadows stir frequently, and danger lurks around every darkened corner.

In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop.\r\n\r\nIF AT FIRST YOU DON’T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN \r\nEvery new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you’ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you’ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted.\r\n\r\nSINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER \r\nAre you the hero or the villain? You’ll experience DEATHLOOP’s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you’ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you’re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna’s stylish sneakers and invade another player’s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign.\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF – PARADISE OR PRISON    \r\nArkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.

By dint of sword, and by way of magical objects known as “rune-lenses,” the land’s history has been shaped by the alliances and aggressions of the humans, beastmen, elves, and desert people who live there.\r\n\r\nThe Galdean Empire has edged out other nations and discovered a technology that amplifies the rune-lenses’ magic.\r\n\r\nNow, the Empire is scouring the continent for an artifact that will expand their power even further. It is on one such expedition that Seign Kesling, a young and gifted imperial officer, and Nowa, a boy from a remote village, meet each other and become friends.\r\n\r\nHowever, a twist of fate will soon drag them into the fires of war, and force them both to reexamine everything they believe to be right and true.\r\n\r\nEiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes became the #1 funded Kickstarter video game of 2020 thanks to phenomenal support from the community. 505 Games is truly honored to publish Eiyuden Chronicle and work with Rabbit & Bear to help deliver a memorable gaming experience to fans.

Hurl burning tree trunks at enemies with telekinetic, snap nearby trees to block opposing fire, or channel raw telekinetic force to rip boulders from the ground. \r\n\r\nWEAVER OF MAGIC\r\nWear the Mantle, a magical cloak that channels raw magic into raging flame, chilling ice, and telekinetic force. Combine your growing array of powers with enchanted weapons and armor crafted from slain enemies to create a custom look and style. Block incoming attacks with a wall of magical ice, lash out waves of flame from a massive two-handed blade, or toss enemies off a cliff with raw force. \r\n\r\nSTAND AGAINST GIANTS\r\nFace gigantic adversaries and defeat them through a mix of sword, spell, and mobility. Leap onto and climb their massive forms to attack from different angles. Shatter armor or slice at weak spots to diminish their protection. Use ice to pin limbs of a towering foe, arcane flames to burn their fur, or catch lobbed projectiles and turn their attacks back upon them in battles that will leave scars upon the land. \r\n\r\nUNSTABLE CLIMATE TO MASTER\r\nEnhance the effectiveness of your ice abilities during a flash freeze to open up new paths. Use a heatwave to start a wildfire and watch it spread towards enemies as it consumes the tinder-dry trees and grass around it. \r\n\r\nA WORLD RICH WITH SECRETS\r\nExplore the wilds, the capital city of Dynevron, and the secrets beneath as every surface is climbable. Magical abilities can create bridges, burn barriers, or launch Brynn across the world. The next-generation physics system encourages and rewards player creativity in exploration as much as combat. As the Enclave’s secrets unfold, return to base camp to consult with a rich cast of characters. Each are keen to discover the mysteries of what happened to this lost bastion of power and knowledge. \r\n\r\nA realm of mystery, opportunity, danger, and wonder: the Enclave awaits. \r\n "},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"eternal-strands","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55883.13736859116442717.a1ffa0ea-8877-44c8-8310-2433a1850d55.289fef47-87b7-442a-baab-439a9636d846","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57348.13736859116442717.5a75a042-ff9f-46c1-a965-4e98c3acb3aa.6c8e2b05-bf09-4852-9830-02442456569a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24755.13736859116442717.5a75a042-ff9f-46c1-a965-4e98c3acb3aa.3dd0c355-746d-41bd-91d8-514bf35a5a6f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37192.13736859116442717.5a75a042-ff9f-46c1-a965-4e98c3acb3aa.f15c2064-5f4b-4a6d-9c2e-a5ab7a432533","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58093.13736859116442717.5a75a042-ff9f-46c1-a965-4e98c3acb3aa.18f7e342-0839-4982-a864-9be8c3be64d3","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47115.13736859116442717.5a75a042-ff9f-46c1-a965-4e98c3acb3aa.84aa1f3e-ab29-4ab2-90aa-0f6761a357dd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19082.13736859116442717.5a75a042-ff9f-46c1-a965-4e98c3acb3aa.1c6580e7-1400-4667-8b82-2714e898f195","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63191.13736859116442717.5a75a042-ff9f-46c1-a965-4e98c3acb3aa.bbe9e176-6a36-4202-8e72-ffffb7040d20","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26689.13736859116442717.5a75a042-ff9f-46c1-a965-4e98c3acb3aa.dcf917e3-b3bf-4c62-8000-44db5af40e16","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10944.13736859116442717.5a75a042-ff9f-46c1-a965-4e98c3acb3aa.8faefd61-0016-4590-9b72-5263ef57b571","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26010.13736859116442717.5a75a042-ff9f-46c1-a965-4e98c3acb3aa.6d0cb1ca-f523-4f5a-b9d7-5e62cfce31b1"],"ReleaseDate":5250422786427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":20954812416},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Simulation"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/expeditions-a-mudrunner-game/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":77},"ID":"9P49LKR1V2Q5","Title":{"en":"Expeditions: A MudRunner Game (Windows)"},"Description":{"en":"Embark on ever-rewarding scientific expeditions as you adapt to nature's challenges and unravel the mysteries of uncharted lands alone or with other players.

As the leader of possibly the last civilized society on Earth, you’re going to build the city your survivors live in, discover new technologies, explore frozen wastelands and most importantly, manage and rule society to prepare it for life in an unforgiving world. Whether you’re an enlightened ruler or an iron-fisted tyrant, you’ll discover choices in this world aren’t as easy as they seem, and that holding power over people has a cost as heavy as the responsibility you feel in caring for them.\r\n\r\nSHAPE YOUR SOCIETY\r\nEstablish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. \r\n\r\nShould you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless.\r\n\r\nEXPAND AND EXPLORE\r\nSurvival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills.\r\n\r\nWhile New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city.

Take the role of a Steward and lead your city through a cascade of calamities taking place in a postapocalyptic, snowy setting. Build large city districts with their string of endless needs and demands. Navigate through conflicting interests of factions that populate your metropolis. As the needs of the city grow and factional power at its core rises, only you can steer the society towards an uncertain future.\n\nThe city grows\nThe world is overtaken by an ever present winter, which makes expansion of the city the only way for the survival of mankind. In order to grow, the metropolis needs resources like coal and oil, just like its citizens require food and warmth. In Frostpunk 2, it's your job to tackle this never ending circle of supply and demand.\n\nCity districts\nYour city is divided into zones serving different purposes, such as housing or extraction. It’s up to you to build new ones and make sure that those already existing work in perfect unison.\n\nSpecial buildings\nIn time, you will have to build places like City Hall or Research Institute. Inside these buildings, you will put forth laws and projects to ensure that your city develops in the proper direction.\n\nColonies\nTo ensure that your city growth will not falter, you have to venture into the frostland. There, you can build extensive colonies that will provide all the necessary resources.\n\nPerlis of human nature\nThe number of your citizens steadily grows, making the task of governing them and satisfying their demands all the more challenging. As the Steward you will have to maneuver carefully across the interests of many groups inhabiting the city.\n\nNew Londoners\nYour citizens can form communities and factions, each with different ideas for the city’s future. In the Council Hall you’ll put forth laws and negotiate them with the faction’s delegates.\n\nCouncil Hall\nSupport of every faction inside the Council Hall costs dearly, as one’s faction ascension breeds discontent among others. That means you have to carefully think through every alliance.\n\nTowards progress\nThe Research Institute is where you forge the city's future. Each new project must be entrusted to a faction, forcing you to maneuver and form strategic alliances.\n\nFactions\nPeople of your city want to have a voice in how you run things. Each faction has its own ideology and ideas for the future, yet they also have one thing in common - insatiable thirst for power. Choose your allies in the Council Hall wisely.\n\nStory Mode and Utopia Builder\nThe story of Frostpunk 2 introduces a multi-chapter saga set in the frozen wastes. Spanning across the life of the Steward this campaign lets you feel the burden of leadership as you take the responsibility for thousands of lives. At the same time, the sandbox mode called Utopia Builder with infinite play time leaves you room for boundless social and infrastructural experiments.\n\n\n\n"},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"frostpunk-2","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4430.13923668312910701.01edfea1-db44-49e5-8fd9-8f546040b4b7.9bb1a96f-07fb-4b50-9506-21ef028813fc","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64735.13923668312910701.52261772-6715-4f05-bb16-8d79675fc72a.4e042805-0918-4f11-b333-f9e55d88c315","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59589.13923668312910701.52261772-6715-4f05-bb16-8d79675fc72a.984d8f4b-4797-4714-8ffa-0014306b3659","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52125.13923668312910701.52261772-6715-4f05-bb16-8d79675fc72a.09c901b9-0648-4714-bc47-dff8e76facb8","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51147.13923668312910701.52261772-6715-4f05-bb16-8d79675fc72a.81984da6-1bb7-42bb-900f-938efbcabe48","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61867.13923668312910701.52261772-6715-4f05-bb16-8d79675fc72a.3063f973-8870-487f-b1e8-83bb2abb2f84","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21638.13923668312910701.52261772-6715-4f05-bb16-8d79675fc72a.00dee10e-69a7-4994-9ce3-b2e2a0af2f02","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13930.13923668312910701.52261772-6715-4f05-bb16-8d79675fc72a.7f02b224-60c5-44d8-8913-fbacd61893f7","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20203.13923668312910701.52261772-6715-4f05-bb16-8d79675fc72a.446e8201-e944-4124-a8ab-f6479f5332dd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61996.13923668312910701.52261772-6715-4f05-bb16-8d79675fc72a.4df9d9aa-b12c-410d-9b00-e40a1d280e15","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41492.13923668312910701.f6d1efa4-2869-4198-98a6-25cbdcafffc2.32038124-1317-4821-9601-f3ad1b7a5766","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25180.13923668312910701.f6d1efa4-2869-4198-98a6-25cbdcafffc2.fdaef2ee-622e-40ac-ac75-03cbf22670a0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34666.13923668312910701.f6d1efa4-2869-4198-98a6-25cbdcafffc2.3cee6255-b9ff-4533-b16a-151e7464d845"],"ReleaseDate":5250310502427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":14920937472},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/full-throttle-remastered/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":77},"ID":"9P3ZRGNQVC7D","Title":{"en":"Full Throttle Remastered"},"Description":{"en":"Released by LucasArts in 1995, Full Throttle is a classic graphic adventure game from industry legend Tim Schafer, telling the story of Ben Throttle, the butt-kicking leader of biker gang the Polecats who gets caught up in a tale of Motorcycles, Mayhem, and Murder.\r\n\r\nNow over 20 years later, Full Throttle is back in a remastered edition featuring all new hand-drawn and 3D high-resolution artwork, with remastered audio and music.\r\n\r\n英語版　※日本語字幕には対応しておりません。"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"full-throttle-remastered","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39265.14598891268352765.09cb1dd7-f055-4038-983d-2721763eedbe.0e1db341-dc19-4da2-8a23-cc7a3476ee6b","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35866.14598891268352765.09cb1dd7-f055-4038-983d-2721763eedbe.48fd99e5-da37-462c-9ddf-e14f596c6836","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44002.14598891268352765.09cb1dd7-f055-4038-983d-2721763eedbe.3d606b0c-6502-4722-add0-83ff7e4d5002","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60427.14598891268352765.09cb1dd7-f055-4038-983d-2721763eedbe.a5a58dc2-cdff-436e-b746-03f868bc496c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19206.14598891268352765.09cb1dd7-f055-4038-983d-2721763eedbe.dac4b1fd-4d7b-4fbb-bae0-08178fa38332","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22907.14598891268352765.09cb1dd7-f055-4038-983d-2721763eedbe.d87bfe6d-758c-4e51-b769-b81e3835f54d","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50879.14598891268352765.09cb1dd7-f055-4038-983d-2721763eedbe.d8f6ffb9-6d8d-48c6-8653-63243df78b37"],"ReleaseDate":5249081894427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":5631930368},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Strategy","Simulation","Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/galacticare/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":80},"ID":"9PB14LD018SM","Title":{"en":"Galacticare"},"Description":{"en":"You are the Director of Galacticare;

Your favorite chaotic sandbox is back and more beautiful than ever, with updated graphics, every DLC, and more bugs that you can shake a goat at. WASD to rewrite history.\n\nYour goal? Chaos! Your muse? Pilgor the goat! If you’ve had your horns in the sand for the last 10 years, Goat Simulator is a game about causing as much destruction as you possibly can, as a goat. Headbutt, backflip and ragdoll your way around each level to earn points, and come up with creative ways to ruin an NPC's day.\n\nGoat Simulator Remastered is the remaster no one asked for. It comes with everything you loved about the original game and more, with new and improved visuals, updated textures, shiny new lighting, and some brand-new foliage showing off the finest in advanced goat simulation technology. We've also completely reworked Mutators, allowing you to pick and choose whichever \"\"goat\"\" you desire from a handy in-game menu. You just have to catch them all first!\n\nThe remaster also includes every DLC from the PC version, and one of our favorites from the mobile version, including:\n- Goat City Bay\n- Goat MMO\n- Goat Z\n- PAYDAY\n- Waste Of Space\n- (Mobile) Buck to School\n\nThere are also less exciting new things, like general optimization and bug fixing - but we promise we mainly fixed the boring ones. \n\nKey Features:\nYou can be a goat… again\nNo really, that’s still the main selling point\nA brand spanking new mutator menu that lets you mix and match goats to your heart's content - if your contentment means abominations\nAs buggy as you remember -  just because it's a remaster doesn’t mean we haven’t left in an unhealthy dose of physics-based bugs because why not?\nAll DLCs included - we could have sold them separately to you again, but if we’re honest this is already a cash-grab\nNew and improved graphics, lighting, VFX and animations - as well as revamped foliage for the prettiest leaves you’ll see in a Goat Sim game excluding Goat Simulator 3\n\nDisclaimer:\nGoat Simulator Remastered is a completely stupid game and has been a completely stupid game since we first invented goat simulation over 10 years ago.

It may or may not change over time or release as a final product. Purchase only if you are comfortable with the current state of the unfinished game.\n\nA long-forgotten enemy rises and brings portents of doom – the Demon King is coming, and without a champion to strike him down, the world will surely fall to his corruption. Seek out powerful weapons and artifacts by day, stand against his minions by night, and prepare to be hunted by powerful entities from ages past in this roguelite role-playing game.\n\nEvery three days, a terrifying new minion of the Demon King begins his hunt, drawn from a pool of over 30 potential bosses. Study each monster’s strengths and unique powers, and adapt your build accordingly. Explore the realm in search of the weapons and equipment best suited to defeat this powerful predator, but be wary of other fell creatures that roam the world by night. With limited time, will you opt to sharpen your blade at hidden ancient forges, pay a high price for rare trinkets from greedy merchants, or seek out mighty armor and magical shields? Choose the tools that work best against the powerful enemy that hunts you today, without sacrificing your preparedness for what comes next, overcoming the guardians of each realm until the Demon King Himself stands before you.\n\nPREPARE FOR DEATH\nPursue a multitude of strategies and synergies with over 350 items at your disposal to confront the unique challenge of each monstrous boss. When hunted by the Razorclaw Grizzly, whose fierce attacks ignore all armor, how much armor will you sacrifice for equipment that prioritizes  maximum health, speed, or damage? The lesser monsters stalking the realms will wage a war of attrition against an unarmored hero, and should the Razorclaw Grizzly be slain, three days may not provide enough time to gather enough armor for the next great foe that hunts you. You may, in place of armor, find several items that enhance your speed and attack strength, allowing you to strike first and hard, vanquishing your enemy swiftly – sometimes before it’s able to strike at all. Then, if you luck upon the Saffron Feather, you’d be able to take advantage of your high speed to help regenerate wounds during battle. But should you find yourself hunted by the Black Knight, who absorbs your attack power as his own, high armor becomes a priority over raw attack strength – with the aid of Razor Scales armor to reflect damage back upon your enemy, and enchanted Ruby Earrings to inflict damage every other turn, the Black Knight would face steady damage without raw attack power to absorb for himself. But if you happen upon a powerful magical weapon, do you dare take it up, knowing it will strengthen the Black Knight for the fight ahead, but come to your aid should you survive it?\n\nThere are a plethora of options for each threat, with a variety of powerful combinations to be discovered and exploited at your disposal among the countless items, and constant tradeoffs between the near and long-term threats – with limited space in your inventory, you must choose wisely and adapt constantly.\n\nBATTLE OTHER PLAYERS\nHe is Coming also features an asynchronous multiplayer mode, Kingmaker – seek out the fallen Demon King’s crown in an ultimate test of your strategies where your champion faces off against the powerful builds of other players. Plan around the equipment and abilities of these would-be heroes in the hunt for the crown, and face a constant onslaught of unique combinations and unforeseeable circumstances – how will you rise above all others?\n\nGROW IN STRENGTH\nYou will face both great victories and noble defeats. Each run will contribute to your progression as you complete over 100 unique challenges that add powerful new artifacts to the pool of items available for future runs – while your first hero may not defeat the Demon King, their efforts will not be in vain.\n\nThe world descends slowly into chaos as the Demon King grows in strength – the trees wither away, the grass turns to ash, and the bogs turn putrid with the stench of death. Take on the mantle of a hero and prepare yourself – for He is Coming.\n\nFull details on the latest status of the game, how you can give feedback and report issues can be found at https://discord.com/invite/w6rDh4gRPN."},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"he-is-coming-game-preview","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":0,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23863.14054902319068378.1242797e-f749-4908-8275-ba478258f0e3.3152133e-a131-4f39-9658-a9d4addc9868","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":false,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5250569558427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":362221568},"MetacriticPlatform":null,"AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Shooter"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/hell-let-loose/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":79},"ID":"9N44WK3WV2HJ","Title":{"en":"Hell Let Loose"},"Description":{"en":"Join the chaos of war and be a part of the most iconic battles of the Eastern and Western Fronts, including Carentan, Omaha Beach, Stalingrad, Kursk and more.

When a sector is captured, it will generate one of three resources for your team, creating a complex game that will influence your team’s march to victory. Strategy is key to success.\r\n\r\nHell Let Loose is not about kill to death ratios – teamwork is central to gameplay. Communication is essential. Players work together beneath the leadership of Officers and their Commander to take strategic targets on the battlefield and dominate the opposition. In Hell let loose, it’s always better to tackle things as a team. If you think you can handle the chaos of war, we’ll see you on the

Choose your champion and pick your path to power: a single-player roguelite romp through the world of League of Legends and Arcane, or a ranked card battler where strategy reigns supreme. Unlock and level up dozens of characters in a hand-crafted love letter to fans of hero collectors and card games alike. \n\nTHE STORY SO FAR\nFrom the back alleys of Zaun to celestial Mt. Targon, forces small and large threaten to forever shift the balance of power—if not unravel the world itself! Star-forging dragon Aurelion Sol plots his cataclysmic revenge, while Lissandra, an even greater menace, lurks in the frozen north.\n\nOnly champions of Runeterra can follow the path that has been set—alone or as one—with YOU at the helm.\n\nCHOOSE YOUR CHAMPION\nPlay as Jinx, Warwick, Caitlyn, Vi, Ambessa, or any of a growing cast of 65+ champions. The many legends of League are yours to collect, evolve, and master as you traverse the map of Runeterra.\n\nEach champion brings unique, awe-inspiring powers and loyal followers to the fray. Whether you freeze your opponents where they stand (Ashe), plant fungal surprises for sneaky victories (Teemo), build an elaborate combo engine for a spectacular finish (Heimerdinger), no two champions play the same.\n\nADAPT & EVOLVE \nEvery run is a canvas for your creativity, offering new cards, powers, and relics to augment your strategy and topple menacing foes. But choose wisely! Challenges increase in difficulty over the course of a run, and from one World Adventure to the next.\n\nEach champion can be upgraded with Star Powers—permanent augments you can unlock between runs. Completing a champion’s Constellation yields immense power—and all new strategies—for you to command.\n\nTOPPLE MIGHTY FOES\nTest your mettle against iconic villains in World Adventures and Weekly Nightmares that set the stage for your spectacular displays of strategy and skill.\n\nBeating the odds against the likes of Lissandra and Aurelion Sol will take experimentation, ingenuity, and maybe a touch of luck. Of course, the tougher the opponent, the sweeter the victory—and the richer the rewards!\n\nUNCOVER NEW LEGENDS\nDelve into the deep lore and rich, ever-expanding universe treasured by players of League of Legends and fans of the Emmy-winning series Arcane. With exclusive characters, story-driven adventures, breathtaking card art, and a staggering cast of new and familiar faces, there’s no better way to experience the breadth and depth of Runeterra."},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"legends-of-runeterra","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4423.14134368163209494.cd4ca529-da0e-47a6-8316-e2bd8c7fa05b.f0f56ad3-0bc9-438f-8d3e-3b85055ac8a8","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5249750018427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":0},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":78},"ID":"BRMKDCZT0C4L","Title":{"en-us":"LEGO® Star Wars™: The Skywalker Saga"},"Description":{"en-us":"The galaxy is yours in LEGO® Star Wars™: The Skywalker Saga.

It may or may not change over time or release as a final product. Purchase only if you are comfortable with the current state of the unfinished game.\n\nManor Lords is a strategy game that allows you to experience the life of a medieval lord. Grow your starting village into a bustling city, manage resources and production chains, and expand your lands through conquest.\n\nInspired by the art and architecture of late 14th century Franconia, Manor Lords prioritizes historical accuracy wherever possible, using it to inform gameplay mechanics and visuals alike. Common medieval tropes are avoided in favor of historical accuracy in order to make the world feel more authentic, colorful, and believable.\n\nORGANIC CITY BUILDING\nManor Lords provides a gridless city-building experience with full freedom of placement and rotation. Building mechanics are inspired by the growth of real medieval towns and villages, where major trade routes and the landscape influenced how settlements formed and developed.\n\n- Spreading outward from a central marketplace, build your residential, commercial, and industrial districts following the natural lay of the land. Establish farms based on soil fertility, position hunting grounds according to animal populations, and ensure access to adequate resource deposits and forests to provide the raw materials needed for growth.\n- Assign areas for housing and watch your residents build their homes in accordance with the historical burgage plot system. Each area will be subdivided based on your roads and the allotted space, and homes will scale accordingly.\n- Build extensions behind larger homes to generate resources that would not otherwise be available. Homeowners don't just pay taxes – they grow vegetables, raise chickens and goats, and otherwise supply themselves and other townsfolk with essential needs beyond what your managed farms, pastures, and industries can provide.\n- Guide your settlements through the unique demands and opportunities of each season, enjoying the bounty brought by spring rains and preparing for the harsh snows of winter.\n\nRESOURCE MANAGEMENT\nFrom boots to barley and hides to honey, Manor Lords features a great variety of goods fitting of the era. Materials need to be transported and processed into finished products through production chains, and you must balance the basic needs of your people against the desire to produce luxury items to ensure happiness, manufacture trade goods for export, or forge arms and armor to aid in your conquests.\n\n- Resources are littered across the map, encouraging you to expand and establish multiple specialized settlements. Extract valuable ores from your mining colonies, while villages devoted to agriculture, herding, or hunting supply the grains and meats needed to feed your growing populations. Will you spend your hard-earned influence to first acquire a rich source of iron for your smiths, or will you prioritize regions with fertile soil to serve as your breadbasket? \n- Unchecked expansion will have a direct effect on the environment. Herds of deer will migrate away from encroaching civilization, lack of crop rotation will worsen soil fertility, and cutting down too many trees will result in deforestation.\n- Establish trade routes and sell surplus goods to traveling merchants to enrich your population. Manufacturing and exporting a variety of goods will provide wealth with which to upgrade your peoples’ homes, import goods you can’t produce yourself, and through taxes on said wealth, fill your own coffers.\n\nMEDIEVAL WARFARE\nYours is but a small parcel of land in a vast territory, and the competing ambitions between you and rival lords will inevitably lead to conflict. Lead your people into battle, not as expendable units to be easily replenished, but as your beloved loyal subjects where every death is a cost worth considering.\n\n- Train a retinue of skilled warriors to fight battles alongside the levies you raise from the town militia. At times these soldiers will be needed to suppress banditry, and at other times you will lead your men into battle to conquer or defend territory. When needed, mercenaries are a costly option to bolster your ranks. Will you raise the militia at the first sign of trouble, bringing your economy to a stand-still as your peasants pick up arms and rush to form ranks, or will you spend your personal wealth to hire bands of sellswords instead?\n- Command real-time tactical battles, taking into consideration fatigue, weather conditions, and equipment. Position your troops wisely – a smaller force can defeat a larger enemy, if commanded well.\n- Feel the cost of battle, even in victory, as each fallen soldier represents a lost person from your city.\n\nHAND CRAFTED\nThis game is a passion project started by a solo developer, grown through player support into a full team of passionate individuals ranging from programmers and 2D artists to Game and Map Designers. You can reach out to us and share your opinions, ideas, and criticisms – we listen to your feedback."},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"manor-lords-game-preview","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37819.14574664570876265.de10a2b3-2508-4c92-80c3-5c42384817e9.ab136f62-5b29-4c78-b543-11893326536c","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":false,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5250024554427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":12390875136},"MetacriticPlatform":null,"AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Role playing"],"MetacriticUrls":{},"MetaScore":{},"ID":"9MTP3NKHVWM6","Title":{"en":"Mass Effect 2 (2010 Edition)"},"Description":{"en":"Are you prepared to lose everything to save the galaxy?

You’ll fight alongside some of your most trustworthy crew members, but you’ll also get the opportunity to recruit new talent.

For years, the colorful cast of The Friendly Neighborhood delighted audiences across the globe with their cooky capers and educational adventures. However, as time went on and interest waned, the production studio found themselves out of money and closed their doors for good. Toy sales would dwindle, and birthday balloons and cakes would find new mascots. In time, the once household names would fade into increasingly niche fandoms. Until one night years later, the studio unexpectedly clicks back to life and starts broadcasting The Friendly Neighborhood. TV sets across the globe flicker for a moment before the familiar puppets return for a surprise encore! But this isn't your typical family-friendly holiday special... are those puppets eating each other!?\n\nThinking the antenna on top of the main building has started broadcasting old episodes, the city sends Handyman Gordon to straighten things out. It doesn't take Gordon long to find that the typically friendly neighborhood has become a lot less welcoming. Stepping into his work boots, you'll have to fend off ferocious friends, solve a plethora of playtime puzzles turned perilous, and hopefully uncover the dastardly truth at the heart of this terrifying tale.\n\nIf you're tired of games that rely on gore more than solid scares, then come on over to the streets of MFN! Featuring a mix of action and adventure, MFN is the perfect game for horror fans looking for something a bit different. Sure, there might not be any dismemberment or decapitations.

Fly smoothly from deep space to planetary surfaces, with no loading screens, and no limits. In this infinite procedurally generated universe, you'll discover places and creatures that no other players have seen before - and perhaps never will again.\n\nEmbark on an epic voyage\nAt the centre of the galaxy lies a irresistible pulse which draws you on a journey towards it to learn the true nature of the cosmos. But, facing hostile creatures and fierce pirates, you'll know that death comes at a cost, and survival will be down to the choices you make over how you upgrade your ship, your weapon and suit.\n\nFind your own destiny\nYour voyage through No Man's Sky is up to you. Will you be a fighter, preying on the weak and taking their riches, or taking out pirates for their bounties? Power is yours if you upgrade your ship for speed and weaponry.\nOr a trader? Find rich resources on forgotten worlds and exploit them for the highest prices. Invest in more cargo space and you'll reap huge rewards.\nOr perhaps an explorer? Go beyond the known frontier and discover places and things that no one has ever seen before. Upgrade your engines to jump ever farther, and strengthen your suit for survival in toxic environments that would kill the unwary.\n\nShare your journey\nThe galaxy is a living, breathing place. Trade convoys travel between stars, factions vie for territory, pirates hunt the unwary, and the police are ever watching. Every other player lives in the same galaxy, and you can choose to share your discoveries with them on a map that spans known space.

It may or may not change over time or release as a final product. Purchase only if you are comfortable with the current state of the unfinished game.\n\nYou play as a Monarch in possession of an ancient soul-stealing crown with magical abilities. With its power, establish a kingdom in a perilous wilderness and defend it from mutants and bandits roaming the land. \n\nBuild, gather resources, farm the land and more to turn your fledgling realm into a commanding, self-sustaining kingdom. As your fame grows, more will flock to your banner – but so will those who have come to overthrow you, including your friends in up to six-player co-op.\n\nBUILD ANYWHERE\nConstruct a kingdom from scratch and transform the wilderness into a developed community. Decide which buildings go where, and then manage your citizens to automate everything from there! Don’t like where you placed something? Just pick it up and toss it somewhere else!\n\nLIFT ANYTHING\nThrow whole trees at the sawmill to make planks or run through the forest carrying your sawmill to absorb trees along the way! Resource gathering is fun and easy thanks to your crown’s power. Or maybe you have too many enemies around. Pick up monster nests and place them near bandit camps to have them fight each other instead (and obtain free loot!).\n\nFIGHT LIKE AN ANIME PROTAGONIST\nVillagers being eaten by mutants? Run across a lake at 100 km/h to rescue them in time! Being shot at by outlaws up in the hills? Spin-attack so fast that you take off like a helicopter and descend on them from the skies!\n\nSURVIVE THE SEASONS\nManage resources and stockpile enough food to last the winter.

It is subject to change before its release as a finished product. Please purchase only if you are comfortable with the game in its current state.\n\nQ. What kind of game is this?\nA. In this game, you can peacefully live alongside mysterious creatures known as Pals or risk your life to drive off a ruthless poaching syndicate.\nPals can be used to fight and breed, or they can be made to work on farms or factories.\nYou can even sell them or eat them.\n\n▼Survival\nIn a harsh environment where food is scarce and vicious poachers roam, danger waits around every corner. To survive, you must tread carefully and make difficult choices...even if that means eating your own Pals when the time comes.\n\n▼Mounts & Exploration\nPals can be mounted to traverse the land, sea and sky—allowing you to traverse all kinds of environment as you explore the world.\n\n▼Building Structures\nWant to build a pyramid? Put an army of Pals on the job. There are no labor laws for Pals, so exploit them to your heart's content.\n\n▼Production\nFind a variety of useful Pals to make fire, generate electricity, or mine ore so that you can live a life of comfort.\n\n▼Farming\nSome Pals are good at planting seeds, while others are skilled at watering or harvesting crops. Work together with your Pals to create an idyllic farmstead.\n\n▼Factories & Automation\nLetting Pals do the work is the key to automation. Build a factory, place a Pal in it, and they'll keep working as long as they're fed—until they're dead, that is.\n\n▼Dungeon Exploration\nWith Pals on your side you can tackle even the most dangerous areas. When the time comes, you might have to sacrifice one to save your skin. They'll protect your life—even if it costs their own.\n\n▼Breeding & Genetics\nBreed a Pal and it will inherit the characteristics of its parents. Combine rare pals to create the strongest Pal of them all!\n\n▼Poaching & Crime\nEndangered Pals live in wildlife sanctuaries. Sneak in and capture rare Pals to get rich quick! It's not a crime if you don't get caught, after all.\n\n▼Multiplayer\nMultiplayer is supported, so invite a friend and go on an adventure together! And of course you can battle your friends and trade Pals, too.\nIn online co-op play mode, up to 4 players can play together.\nMeanwhile, a dedicated server can allow up to 32 players to play together.\n\nCollect all kinds of exciting Pals to fight, farm, build, and work for you in this completely new multiplayer, open world survival and crafting game!"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"palworld-game-preview","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64359.13654268679289325.5cd9109c-5095-44b3-a4a2-0bbf822058b7.d23fd29a-8afc-45bf-8ae4-20983e5ea746","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":false,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42368.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.8d70e6c3-3f80-4433-9720-1cbabc621ec6","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61138.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.fd7eb204-dc7f-4107-a237-c191d63a47cd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55732.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.88b644de-dd0d-486c-a3a7-dfd26c3e3b2e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39973.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.2e7d429e-6749-4a77-a51c-c367e73a9175","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5789.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.6c3c163b-0362-457f-b0f6-f62ff9388750","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52925.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.b2e45903-d5d1-4911-983e-efff17ee7277","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30971.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.ca18135b-9f35-40ab-9999-89960a8cb441","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10748.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.6acfb2bc-dfdb-4106-a0ba-82a6489fc51c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14003.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.394a498c-f60b-46e2-9ef0-05af8ea3dc52","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21475.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.34450769-d837-414b-bb16-f1ce8365bf86","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32586.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.d4e1b4d3-e291-4ecf-ad8e-8826a6c4f7f5","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50425.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.7e860136-9e36-441d-9ddb-2740d979e350","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.552.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.947bdcff-d499-408f-bac8-588d12934011","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19747.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.dcf183b3-48fc-4e8a-b584-ee46cb648452","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19681.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.754865e1-b9aa-4df3-b36d-a5458a3184d3","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31947.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.c4515cfc-aa8d-4bb8-b589-1ba8d115edd1","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52814.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.1cecdbba-5931-4c3a-999c-dbc65d1df1a0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.540.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.f0ae85ea-c4ba-4eea-b74e-5fb236c562ad"],"ReleaseDate":5250098498427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":26545160192},"MetacriticPlatform":null,"AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Family & kids","Platformer"],"MetacriticUrls":{},"MetaScore":{},"ID":"9N3TF03KNTBD","Title":{"en":"PAW Patrol Mighty Pups Save Adventure Bay"},"Description":{"en":"A fallen meteor has given the pups mighty powers – and left Adventure Bay in a mighty mess.

Featuring turn-based tactical combat on procedurally generated maps, and resource management on a global scale, Phoenix Point offers endless replayability and a brutal challenge.\r\n\r\nFollowing a global environmental disaster, the Pandoravirus appeared and began reshaping creatures, including humans, into hideous mutants. Unable to stop the progress of the virus, much of human civilization was wiped out -- only small enclaves remain, separated by their principles and the vast landscape. The Phoenix Project, an ancient failsafe against global catastrophe is the only hope to unite mankind and take back the planet.\r\n\r\nLead the Phoenix Project from its base at Phoenix Point. Research and develop new technologies and techniques, plan operations, build alliances to unite the planet-- or simply destroy your rivals. It's up to you to save the planet and rebuild civilization, but there may be much more to the alien threat than meets the eye.\r\n\r\n* Mutating Alien Menace: Face down an ever-changing alien threat that adapts to your tactics and offers no respite even as your team becomes more powerful and technologically advanced.\r\n\r\n* Uncover the Secrets of the Pandoravirus: Phoenix Point features a complex narrative, with multiple endings that the player can only uncover via multiple playthroughs. Discover a secret history, as you learn about the origins of the mutants, the Pandoravirus, and Phoenix Point itself through exploration, diplomacy, and research.\r\n\r\n* Manage Diplomatic Relations: The Phoenix Project is not the only organization trying to reclaim the Earth. The militaristic New Jericho, the mystical Disciples of Anu, and the technophiles of Synedrion all offer unique rewards for co-operation and threats for opposition. It is up to you to decide how, or even if, to deal with them.\r\n\r\n* Take Aim on the Battlefield: In addition to equipping and commanding units, Phoenix Point lets you take direct control of your soldier's shots in combat, with a unique free-aiming system. Target enemy weakspots, weapons, or valuables, or just go for center mass.\r\n\r\n* Next-Gen Tech with Classic Pedigree: Phoenix Point was designed by Julian Gollop, the creator of the X-COM series in the 1990s. Keeping the core ethos of X-COM while updating the visuals, technology, and systems to modern standards has made Phoenix Point best-in-class."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"phoenix-point","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23750.14507726714197033.ea391b48-d8cb-4724-a6cb-765168bd5161.0029c50b-c234-475e-9928-0185fc83e0aa","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27297.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.8f0d79d4-fb71-4169-bb64-0b77cac69f7f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3522.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.17680a69-6b0d-4293-a53c-6d16fe0035fd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39128.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.c1af4919-7997-458a-ae19-4b9cf83ecfaa","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63541.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.c3d3f2f0-5855-4872-bbdd-720b19605e27","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34869.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.dd0e9d28-4298-463e-98c1-032a9fa45f9c"],"ReleaseDate":5248809122427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":25358311424},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Role playing","Strategy"],"MetacriticUrls":{},"MetaScore":{},"ID":"9N8N7NZSVTG3","Title":{"en":"Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire - Ultimate Edition (PC)"},"Description":{"en":"The award-winning RPG from the masters at Obsidian Entertainment finally arrives, featuring all major updates and expansions. \r\n\r\nThe god Eothas awakens from his slumber, killing you and stealing a piece of your soul.

The Intuition System allows you to pick up on important clues when interrogating witnesses and can help you resolve situations immediately – so make sure you're always paying attention to everything being said and done. Your duties are your responsibility!\r\n\r\nProgressing and unlocking new districts also adds new duties. Begin by issuing tickets, but be ready to handle accidents that can happen right in front of your eyes! Many different duties are waiting to be encountered in this living and breathing city. Stop drug deals from taking place in the local park, chase graffiti sprayers illegally tagging walls, stop speeding cars with your police siren, and even set up road barriers and cones around traffic accidents.

Your destiny is to become a god! But it will not be easy. Not for you, and not for your followers. To become a deity, you must conquer all 25 planets of the system and defeat every other tribe and their shamans. The ultimate struggle will be a difficult one, as you build mystical cities, unleash devastating spells, harness volcanoes and tornadoes, and shape the face of the planet at your will. Remember, your apotheosis awaits!\r\n\r\nIn the third part of the Populous series, you control your shaman and the tribe of her followers in a difficult quest to conquer all 25 planets of a star system and ascend to godhood. For the first time in the series, the world is presented in true 3D, which at the time amazed both the players and the gaming press.The level of control you exert over your followers also takes you to a new level: you can order individuals or groups to perform certain tasks like gathering resources, constructing buildings, or attacking your enemies.\r\n\r\nPopulous: The Beginning takes a slightly different approach from the previous installments of the series but this is not, by any means, a bad thing as it kept the series fresh and innovative. It was a bold move for Bullfrog but the proof exists in the fact that, after all these years Populous 3 is still a great strategy god-game.\r\n\r\n*Conditions and restrictions apply.

With the fleet trapped around Stroggos, only 5% of ground forces surviving, and that number dwindling by the second, your orders have changed: free your comrades and destroy the Gravity Well. \r\n\r\nPlay the All-New “Call of the Machine” Expansion \r\n\r\nA brand-new Quake II experience from MachineGames consisting of 28 campaign levels and one multiplayer deathmatch map.

Explore the open world and immerse yourself in a deep story campaign as you unravel the mystery behind the vampires’ appearance. Ally with a handful of survivors against the creatures threatening to bleed the town dry.\r\n \r\nSlay Alone or Squad Up\r\nRedfall blends single- and multiplayer options seamlessly, allowing the player to venture into the darkness alone or to squad-up for up to four player co-op. Teammates can try different hero loadouts and combine their strengths to find creative solutions to the vampire apocalypse. You will collect an arsenal of specialized weaponry and customize your character with unique upgrades and abilities to suit your playstyle for guns blazing, stealth combat, and everything in-between.\r\n \r\nUnconventional Heroes Vs. The Night\r\nCreated by science experiments gone wrong and gifted with psychic abilities, Redfall’s vampires will challenge you and your squad to get creative. You will choose from a team of diverse heroes – each with their own character-specific abilities – to overcome the vampire legion and their brood of maniacal followers. \r\n- DEVINDER CROUSLEY – The Verified Cryptid Hunter: A cryptozoologist and aspiring inventor. Armed with weapons of his own creation, he’s on a mission to prove himself.\r\n- LAYLA ELLISON – The Telekinetic Threat: A biomedical engineering student who volunteered for a medical trial where something went very wrong, leaving her with intense telekinetic abilities.\r\n- REMI DE LA ROSA – The Ingenious Ingeniera: A brilliant combat engineer who has spent her life on the frontlines.

Strange happenings on Redfall have left Jacob with a mysterious vampiric eye and a spectral raven that’s never far from his side.\r\n\r\nThe Open World of Redfall\r\nRedfall is a true Arkane experience set in a rich world that blends the familiar with the extraordinary.  Redfall’s open world is handcrafted by the master level designers behind Prey’s Talos I space station and Dishonored’s Dunwall. From the town’s once-bustling downtown and the haunted forest to the decimated seaside boardwalk and beyond, you will fight through cultist outposts and supernatural psychic spaces as you piece together Redfall’s many mysteries."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"redfall","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60545.14091188428798620.2f105d2c-1b7f-4fd0-b12e-5483087f47d1.0dd8d438-0fc9-4d71-ac1b-21ed62e26ec2","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59879.14091188428798620.2f105d2c-1b7f-4fd0-b12e-5483087f47d1.f5ee4981-d0af-4cab-a54b-1efe4a6a9c7b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26451.14091188428798620.2f105d2c-1b7f-4fd0-b12e-5483087f47d1.b5ef54df-fd9a-4a8c-b8b0-d369d81c1cb3","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7297.14091188428798620.2f105d2c-1b7f-4fd0-b12e-5483087f47d1.cfcd6112-0fd3-452b-8f51-f07de14766ee","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8675.14091188428798620.2f105d2c-1b7f-4fd0-b12e-5483087f47d1.2b2b2f75-3c4c-407d-99a3-25af0b1a7ddd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51509.14091188428798620.2f105d2c-1b7f-4fd0-b12e-5483087f47d1.6cd2cd6f-43d2-4856-978e-3b460841b490","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18324.14091188428798620.2f105d2c-1b7f-4fd0-b12e-5483087f47d1.a690aecb-3b7f-4f9a-ab7e-994db308109b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8788.14091188428798620.2f105d2c-1b7f-4fd0-b12e-5483087f47d1.bde8360b-feb7-49fa-9df6-f05a7d15d95f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54692.14091188428798620.2f105d2c-1b7f-4fd0-b12e-5483087f47d1.a00a9c81-b13f-49dd-8e1e-090433714c63"],"ReleaseDate":5249871842427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":101325934592},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Sports","Action & adventure","Multi-player Online Battle Arena"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/rematch/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":75},"ID":"9N5K7HWXL4Q6","Title":{"en":"REMATCH"},"Description":{"en":"A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON FOOTBALL\nThird Person Action - Tackle, dribble, aim, and shoot; dive into the heart of the action from an immersive viewpoint.\nOne Player Control - Observe the action, position yourself, execute perfectly: every decision matters, and relying on your teammates is essential to prevail.\nSkill-based Gameplay - In a level playing field, with no player stats, victory is only about player skill and tactical coordination. \n\nINTENSE ACTION & DEEP TACTICS\nCredible Football, with an arcade twist - Feel like an amazing athlete, easily performing all the iconic moves of football. \nNon-stop Action - No fouls, no offsides, no pauses... no time to rest. \nAccessible mechanics with a lot of depth - Just like real football, winning requires both accuracy, fast reactions  as well as flawless team collaboration.\n \nAN ONLINE TEAM-BASED EXPERIENCE\nTeam-based online gameplay - Designed from the ground up as an online multiplayer experience, Rematch offers split-second gameplay response that always feels fair.\nCompetitive Modes - Challenge yourself and your mates to reach the top leagues.\nSeasonal content - There's always something new around the corner.

His true love, Elaine Marley, has turned her focus away from governing and Guybrush himself is adrift and unfulfilled, having never found the Secret of Monkey Island. Hip, young pirate leaders led by Captain Madison have shuffled the old guard from power, Melee Island has taken a turn for the worse, and famed businessman Stan has been imprisoned for ‘marketing-related crimes’.\r\n\r\nBanter with old friends and new faces on familiar islands now under dangerous new leadership. Then, take to the high seas and explore the new and unknown as you work your way out of tough predicaments.

Define your distinctive combat style, select the most efficient weapon, and customize it to your taste for maximal tactical advantage.\nA wise stalker said: the most dangerous weapon is not the gun in your holster but the gumption, tenacity, and sharp reflexes.

Magic has returned to the world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Technology merges with flesh and consciousness. Elves, trolls, orks and dwarves walk among us, while ruthless corporations bleed the world dry. You are a shadowrunner - a mercenary living on the fringes of society, in the shadows of massive corporate arcologies, surviving day-by-day on skill and instinct alone. When the powerful or the desperate need a job done, you get it done... by any means necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the urban sprawl of the Seattle metroplex, the search for a mysterious killer sets you on a trail that leads from the darkest slums to the city’s most powerful megacorps. You will need to tread carefully, enlist the aid of other runners, and master powerful forces of technology and magic in order to emerge from the shadows of Seattle unscathed.\r\n\r\nThe unique cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation over 30 years ago. Return to the world of Shadowrun, with this cult-classic turn-based tactical RPG.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\nGripping Tactical Combat: When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With the variety of weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices. A successful run requires commanding a team of runners with the right balance of combat, tech, and magical abilities.\r\n\r\nSkill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun Returns’ classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose. Want to start summoning spirits as an ork Shaman and evolve into a cybered-up weapon specialist? Do it!\r\n\r\nEngaging 2D/3D Art Style: Shadowrun Returns mixes dynamic 3D characters and lighting with a vibrant, hand-painted environment.

Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall.\r\n\r\nIt’s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge’s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the “Flux State” controls the city of Berlin. It’s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there’s no better place to earn a quick payday.\r\n\r\nNow, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return…\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\nA Classic, Story-Driven cRPG: Dragonfall hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG’s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development.

The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses.

Fight against the Nazi war machine with an ally to share weapons, items and tactical know-how, as well as help each other get back in the fight when you go down during firefights.\n\nVISCERAL X-RAY KILL CAM AND ADVANCED GUNPLAY PHYSICS \nThe trademark X-ray kill cam returns, showing the true destructive power of every one of your signature shots. Bones deflect bullets to unpredictably rip new paths through enemy bodies and SMGs and pistols also trigger kill cams, showing multiple bullet shots in dramatic slow motion.\nTo land that shot you will need to think like a true sniper. Factor in rifle stock and barrel options along with gravity, wind and heart rate while you zero your sights on the target.\n\nAUTHENTIC WORLD WAR II WEAPONS AND CUSTOMISATION \nThe arsenal at your disposal will feature returning franchise favourites as well as a host of new authentic WWII weapons. Picking your loadout will be key to striking down the Reich’s nefarious plans! \nCustomise your weapon to suit your operating style. Find workbenches scattered around the campaign to customise and upgrade your rifles, secondaries and pistols with new scopes, stocks, barrels, magazines and more.

Who the heck are you?! Can you see me? You CAN, can't you? You've drunk the Spirittea and now you can see me!! Look, we've got problems! This town is crawling with troublemaking spirits. They've become lost because humans have stopped worshipping, leaving offerings or even thinking about them anymore.\r\n\r\nThis is- well... used to be a nice town, but there have been some strange goings-on lately! You're going to find the spirits causing mayhem and fix their problems so they can become paying customers, and get to know the townspeople and explore the mountain to its fullest!\r\n\r\nHere's the stuff you'll want to get involved in:\r\n\r\n-Solving the spirit's problems - To remember themselves, they'll need anything from some spicy noodles to finding and digging up their lost treasures, so get your problem-solving hat on!\r\n-Making friends with the locals - The townspeople all have their own schedules, likes, dislikes and hobbies to take part in - from bug catching to karaoke, there's something for everyone!\r\n-Managing the bathhouse - You'll need to clean towels, chop wood to heat the baths and seat the spirits with their friends for the ultimate bathing experience.\r\n-Upgrading and decorating - The local shops can make a whole lot of cool furniture and help you fix up overgrown areas of the bathhouse. We should make it big and fancy enough to take on all the spirits!\r\n\r\nTHE BATHHOUSE\r\n\r\nThe bathhouse is an ancient spirit building hidden up in the mountain, and it's up to you to clean it up and fill it full of customers! Once the spirits are in the bathhouse, you'll need to clean towels, chop wood to heat the baths and seat the spirits with their friends for the ultimate bathing experience. Each spirit has their own preferences so you'll need to get to know them all and upgrade the bathhouse to become the best bathhouse keeper around.\r\n\r\nTo keep your bathhouse running, you'll need to:\r\n-Keep the bathhouse and towels clean - Grab your trusty broom to sweep away the cobwebs and collect up all your towels, you'll need to keep everything clean, dry and organised.\r\n-Deliver a five-star service with food and scrubbing - Get ready to pamper your spirits with food straight from your kitchen and a give them a good scrub while they're relaxing! \r\n-Make the water perfect for each spirit - Chop wood for the boilers to heat up the water to the perfect temperature and mix up various elixirs to make the water perfect for each spirit - they'll all have their preferences and favourite recipes!\r\n-Sit friends together and enemies apart - Every spirit has others they like best, as well as some they don't enjoy spending time with at all! You'll have to plan carefully when you lead spirits to their baths - don't seat just anyone together! Unless, of course, you don't care about making money.  Which I do.

It may or may not change over time or release as a final product. Purchase only if you are comfortable with the current state of the unfinished game.\r\n\r\nAn extraterrestrial probe is detected approaching Earth. Unknown to humanity, an alien force has arrived in the far reaches of the icy Kuiper Belt and has begun mining a dwarf planet to prepare for an invasion.\r\n\r\nWith Earth’s nations unable to unite to address the alien arrival, transnational groups of like-minded political, military, and scientific leaders develop covert channels to coordinate a response. With the aliens' motives uncertain, factions emerge, driven by hope, fear, or greed.\r\n\r\nYou will control one of these factions;\r\n- The Resistance works to form an alliance of nations to mount a coordinated defense\r\n- Humanity First vows to exterminate the aliens alongside any who sympathize with them\r\n- The Servants worship the aliens and believe they will solve all the troubles of the world\r\n- The Protectorate advocates negotiated surrender as the only means to avoid annihilation\r\n- The Academy hopes the alien arrival heralds the opportunity to form an interstellar alliance\r\n- The Initiative seeks to profit from the chaos and destruction\r\n- Project Exodus plans to build a massive starship and flee the Solar System\r\n\r\nINVESTIGATE THE ALIEN THREAT\r\nA distant anomaly, a mysterious crash site, and a spike in reported disappearances. Could this truly be humanity's first contact with extraterrestrial lifeforms? As your field agents investigate sightings and your scientists race to explore new fields of research, you will slowly learn the truth behind the alien arrival.\r\n\r\n- From early sightings and UFO crash sites to rampaging alien megafauna and robotic armies, it will rapidly become clear that the other six human factions are not your sole competition. Throughout the game, illustrated events will present you with difficult choices as you investigate growing alien activity on Earth. Uncover the mystery of the aliens’ origins and motives – unless, of course, you are Humanity First, and all that matters to you is extermination.\r\n- Terra Invicta has a global research system that creates opportunities for both competition and cooperation. Shared scientific advancement unlocks private engineering projects. Factions can choose to focus on private projects, at the cost of weakening Earth as a whole and ceding influence over global research direction to other factions with different priorities. Left unchecked, factions like the Servants or the Initiative may steer the world’s efforts toward developing methods of social control, rather than propulsion or weapon systems.\r\n\r\nCOMPETE FOR CONTROL\r\nYou begin on Earth as the head of a shadowy organization devoted to your chosen ideology. The aliens are coming – soon – but your first enemies (and perhaps allies) will be other human factions.\r\n\r\n- Lead a faction united by ideology, rather than a nation defined by territory. This is a stark change from most strategy games – in Terra Invicta, you will not paint the map with the colors of some chosen nation. Instead you will rule from the shadows and compete with other factions for control points representing a region's military, economic, and political leadership.\r\n- Geopolitics is your sandbox – unite or break apart nations as best serves your ends, while using those under your influence to conduct proxy wars against the other six factions. Earth’s regions are modeled in detail, from educational levels and unrest to GDP and inequality. Gaining command over regions with great monetary wealth and military power can allow you to implement your will on Earth, but the war for the Solar System will not be won without also securing regions containing space launch facilities.\r\n- Enact your will through a council of politicians, scientists, and operatives sent around the world (and even into space). The starting abilities of these councilors will improve through gaining experience and acquiring control over powerful organizations like intelligence agencies or wealthy corporations. A veteran commander may make the perfect choice to lead a tactical team under the council’s direction, while an experienced diplomat works to secure the funding needed to resist the alien invasion.\r\n- Seek out like-minded populations and politicians and take actions to convert followers of opposing ideologies. Public opinion is modeled along multiple axes – the Servants’ alien worship and the Protectorate’s advocacy of negotiated surrender may largely align in terms of support or opposition to the aliens, but events that show the aliens can be defeated have the potential to convince followers of the Protectorate that resistance is a realistic choice.\r\n\r\nEXPAND ACROSS A DYNAMIC SOLAR SYSTEM\r\nTerra Invicta bridges the gap between our modern-day world and the vast interstellar empires of other space strategy games, asking you to take humanity’s first steps in colonizing our Solar System, where over 300 asteroids, moons, and planets in constant motion create an ever-changing strategic map.\r\n\r\n- Take your faction beyond the confines of Earth, building space stations to act as shipyards and fuel depots, constructing mining stations to acquire advanced resources, and establishing bases to serve as research or construction facilities. Terra Invicta zooms into the strategic geography of the Solar System, presenting space not as a series of isolated stars that you order units to move to and from, but rather a rich and varied landscape of asteroids, moons, dwarf planets, gas giants, and other celestial bodies creating texture and tactical opportunities at every turn.\r\n- The expansive map is constantly shifting as celestial bodies orbit the Sun. This means your space stations and forward operating bases are constantly moving as well, forcing you to plan accordingly and adapt to the evolving circumstances – your colonies among the Jovian moons could find that a once-distant alien military outpost or Initiative privateering base has suddenly become a close neighbor.\r\n\r\nHARD SCI-FI MEETS STRATEGY\r\nTerra Invicta explores what might be – how colonies on Mars might function, what plausible engines could power our spaceships, and the nature of how space colonization and warfare might proceed. Players may find themselves establishing a mining base on the asteroid 16 Psyche after noticing it is rich in metals – and then learn that in our world NASA is planning The Psyche Mission for the same reason.\r\n\r\n- Exploring and eventually colonizing space will require access to many resources: water for life support and propellant, metals for manufacturing, fissiles for nuclear drives and weapons, and more. At the start, you’ll have no choice but to acquire such resources on Earth and suffer the high cost of using rockets to escape Earth’s gravity, but over time you’ll increasingly choose to instead rely on asteroid mining and other means of securing local supply.\r\n- Spaceship design in Terra Invicta draws from the best of scientific speculation and hard science fiction. You can design your own ships, selecting from an array of weapons, drives, and other modules to place on a variety of hulls, ensuring each ship has the right mix of fuel capacity, maneuverability, and other capabilities.\r\n- Tactical combat is built around a realistic simulation of Newtonian physics, where momentum and maneuver in 3D space are just as important as the firepower your ships carry. Fire missiles and use point defense cannons to destroy incoming projectiles; build up momentum then swing hard to bring the enemy into your firing arcs; or grapple with the difficult decision to retract radiators and sacrifice heat dissipation to achieve better armor against an incoming enemy barrage.\r\n\r\nBUILT FOR MODS\r\nTerra Invicta is built with modding support in mind, and much of the game is accessible to modders without a coding background. We hope that the Solar System setting and geopolitics simulation will provide a useful framework for modders to realize their own creative visions."},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"terra-invicta-game-preview","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50360.14128659347127760.50ff03f9-5305-4110-a165-58d579d11a5f.48b27e18-0fdd-418a-813f-bd5a23739c73","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":false,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5250150518427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":25909243904},"MetacriticPlatform":null,"AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-alters/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":85},"ID":"9N0P25WJHM8C","Title":{"en":"The Alters"},"Description":{"en":"SURVIVAL HAS NEVER BEEN SO PERSONAL\nThe Alters is an ambitious sci-fi survival game with a unique twist. You play as Jan Dolski, the lone survivor of a crash-landed expedition on a hostile planet. To survive, you must form a new crew for your mobile base. Using a substance called Rapidium, you create alternative versions of Jan—THE ALTERS—each one shaped by a different crucial decision from the protagonist’s past.\n\nCreate Your Alters\nUse the quantum computer onboard your base to simulate alternate outcomes of your past choices and uncoverJan’s different life paths. Each Alter brought to life thanks to the remarkable properties of Rapidium comes with unique skills and emotional depths. These variantions offer both opportunities and challenges as you navigate personal struggles and manage the fragile dynamics of your crew.\n\nSurvival Mechanics\nTo operate the mobile base, you’ll need to explore the planet’s surface in search of precious resources, like metals and organics. Yet venturing outside the safe haven comes with the risk of exposing you and your Alters to various deadly anomalies as well as the ever-present radiation of the sun. That’s why you must pay attention to the in-game day and night cycle and plan your daily activities wisely!\n\nBranching Storylines\nNavigate a narrative rich with moral dilemmas and branching paths. Your choices will shape Jan’s relations with his Alters which then will impact their journey and lead you to multiple outcomes and endings.\n\nExpand your base\nGathered resources can be used in different ways – create necessary items or develop your base with additional modules like Research Lab or Social Room. Sometimes you will have to choose between creating items specially for your Alters and ones that could push the mission forward, like Anomaly Detectors or Radiation Filters. The burden of every decision lies solely on your shoulders as you will never be able to satisfy everyone’s needs.\n\nExploration\nThe planet features unique biomes and secrets waiting to be found, but deadly anomalies stand in your way. Levitating rocks and eerie distortions of reality attract attention immediately, while other singularities remain invisible to the naked eye and require special tools to uncover. In all cases, you must be extra careful - or face the risk of instant death, radiation-induced injuries, and even disintegration of time and space. Also, you may want to avoid exploring the planet during hours when intense radioactivity can eat right through your suit. Happy travels!\n\n\nThe emotional sci-fi story\nJan Dolski is about to face the answers to the essential “what if?” question in the form of alternative versions of himself. This makes the predicament he is in even more daunting as you slowly discover the impact every choice has on Jan’s survival.\n"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"the-alters","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":0,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7753.13917104365848520.a4bd4730-c578-4118-a439-d16f88dde25a.b8d20204-e6cf-4c18-a714-53e1fbb53591","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8071.13917104365848520.b7d988de-8e4d-43dd-920b-51aade417090.3206c511-10a0-4bb9-b3c9-7f2a8189dbd4","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53243.13917104365848520.b7d988de-8e4d-43dd-920b-51aade417090.635feae9-95e4-4f92-934a-daac0f74fe54","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31231.13917104365848520.b7d988de-8e4d-43dd-920b-51aade417090.fb64a8a7-45cd-4470-bd92-635c5612720e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16125.13917104365848520.b7d988de-8e4d-43dd-920b-51aade417090.a55e41e6-6bf8-4477-a0d4-a99813028293","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12147.13917104365848520.b7d988de-8e4d-43dd-920b-51aade417090.17f1e103-fb57-49e2-bf0e-751ba9ed4465","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45930.13917104365848520.b7d988de-8e4d-43dd-920b-51aade417090.60917005-d5b5-4582-a270-2b6a0079fcf4","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2486.13917104365848520.b7d988de-8e4d-43dd-920b-51aade417090.8cd0ba6f-9ab8-4808-8332-adc53d2a06e9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59041.13917104365848520.b7d988de-8e4d-43dd-920b-51aade417090.3046d38a-dc46-41a7-b941-9b07b8a9748f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12606.13917104365848520.b7d988de-8e4d-43dd-920b-51aade417090.5afd5988-ab22-4483-a7da-801de39fa437","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51213.13917104365848520.b7d988de-8e4d-43dd-920b-51aade417090.a858f460-9841-4e08-8ac7-c7df7ffc7c99"],"ReleaseDate":5250540146427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":52663169024},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Role playing","Shooter"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-ascent/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":74},"ID":"C27QL5JBKQ8M","Title":{"en":"The Ascent"},"Description":{"en":"The Ascent is a solo and co-op Action-shooter RPG, set on Veles, a packed cyberpunk world.\r\n\r\nWelcome to The Ascent Group arcology, a corporate-run metropolis stretching high into the sky and filled with creatures from all over the galaxy.
