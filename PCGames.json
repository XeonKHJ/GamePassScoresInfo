Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.\r\n\r\nThe wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.\r\n\r\nMANAGE A DIVERSE POPULATION OF VILLAGERS\r\nFoxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?\r\n\r\nCITY BUILDER MEETS ROGUELITE\r\nExperience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?\r\n\r\nNEVER THE SAME GAME TWICE\r\nWith hundreds of gameplay modifiers and five distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.\r\n\r\nBUILD AN ENDLESS NUMBER OF CITIES\r\nLaying the foundations for a new city is one of the most exciting moments in a city-building game. In Against the Storm, you'll have the opportunity to repeatedly experience this by creating new settlements, while still interacting with your network of previously established cities in a growing world."},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"against-the-storm","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56295.14385363172001343.ef67463b-a065-4ebb-ae31-992199a7c91f.5cf59ead-2745-4f4f-9f20-9527e1ed7dc1","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5250062498427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":4991107072},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Strategy"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/age-of-empires-definitive-edition/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":69},"ID":"9NJWTJSVGVLJ","Title":{"en":"Age of Empires Definitive Edition"},"Description":{"en":"Age of Empires, the pivotal RTS that launched a 20-year legacy returns in definitive form for Windows 10 PCs.

That horrific event may not be a simple accident caused by the house cat. But is she ready to face the truth? Can her already fragile mind survive another trip down the rabbit hole? Her questions can only be answered if you download Alice: Madness Returns.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow that seriously sinister rabbit and leave your fond memories of Wonderland behind.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n\r\n♥ Intense 3rd Person Action – Use multiple upgradeable melee weapons, including the explosive Teapot Cannon, the punishing Hobby Horse, and the classic Vorpal Blade.\r\n\r\n\r\n♦ Explore A Dark And Shattered Wonderland – Encounter familiar but now strange characters, including the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the Caterpillar and the Red Queen.\r\n\r\n\r\n♣ Magical Abilities – Obtain peculiar abilities in Wonderland such as floating with Alice’s dress, shrinking, or growing to towering sizes in order to crush enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n♠ Interactive Puzzles – Intuitive and rewarding puzzles such as transforming obstacles, musical memories, chess, and picture blocks.\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS APPLY.

You awake on a mysterious island, your senses overwhelmed by the blinding sunlight and brilliant colors bouncing off every surface around you, the azure waters of a verdant Island lapping at your bare feet. A deep roar echoes from the misty jungle, jolting you into action, and you stand up – not afraid, but intrigued. Are you ready to form a tribe, tame and breed hundreds of species of dinosaurs and other primeval creatures, explore, craft, build, and fight your way to the top of the food-chain? Your new world awaits… step through the looking-glass and join it!\n\nFEATURES\n\nARK: Survival Ascended has completely recreated and redesigned the artwork and worlds of ARK to take advantage of the latest in videogame technology, Unreal Engine 5, using high-end graphics features such as fully dynamic Global Illumination (“Lumen”), so that light bounces realistically of off surfaces and provides realistic reflections, and advanced mesh streaming (“Nanite”) of hundreds of millions of triangles for extreme detail.\n\nAdvanced new physics systems such as dynamic water so that every creature creates waves, ripples, splashes, and bubbles as they move through fluids, and fully interactive physical foliage where every blade of grass, bush, and tree reacts to characters, explosions, projectiles, and physics objects. Knock down a tree, and see it crash into other trees and disturb all the foliage on its way down to smacking into the grass below! Detect an enemy moving sneakily through the grass as it shifts and sways in response to their presence. Demolish a building and watch the pieces break apart realistically, interacting with the grass and water as they fall.\n\nARK: Survival Ascended includes access to all of ARK’s worlds, including Scorched Earth, Aberration, Extinction, ARK Genesis Part 1, ARK Genesis Part 2, and more. The Island, Scorched Earth, and The Center are released now, with the subsequent expansion worlds to be added at no additional cost on a regular basis.\n\nThe definitive survival experience returns better than ever: design your Survivor, form a tribe, and tame, train, breed & ride dinosaurs within a living ecosystem. Watch your food, water, temperature, and weather patterns. Slowly expand outwards as you harvest, build structures, farm crops, customize your visual designs, and proceed to explore to uncover the true nature of The Island and the worlds beyond. \n\nThorough Quality of Life revamps in every area: redesigned User Interfaces, dynamic navigation for intelligent creature pathfinding, Wild Babies, Photo Mode, new Camera systems, new Map system, Tracking System, new Structures and Items, new Creatures, and much more.\n\nCross-Platform Modding: Download & play new custom content created by players, including new maps, creatures, items, and game modes, through a dedicated new Mod-bowser directly within the game! Enjoy an endless stream of new ARK content as the creativity and talent of the community is fully unleashed for the first time ever across gaming platforms!\n\nCross-Platform Multiplayer: form your online tribe across different gaming platforms as you work together to survive and thrive on the ARK!\n\nSupports public online multiplayer for up to 70 players, private-session multiplayer for up to 8 players, and local split-screen for 2 players."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"ark-survival-ascended","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47381.14545480955348978.f72b621c-2a7f-403c-8bd4-126f7310ad33.c2cc3983-f689-401d-9deb-e46cb33271be","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":false,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13472.14545480955348978.6df932ed-6670-40c9-9a84-fc164557d4ec.73c5dcc2-7fdc-4b6a-86c6-9bc138cf2e64","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52851.14545480955348978.6df932ed-6670-40c9-9a84-fc164557d4ec.4912457c-55f6-4a79-bb69-e37d7c44b453","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39566.14545480955348978.6df932ed-6670-40c9-9a84-fc164557d4ec.02028d27-12f2-4022-8bfa-e64e30fd0916","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46978.14545480955348978.6df932ed-6670-40c9-9a84-fc164557d4ec.928c0d98-a24d-4b68-8fed-88148dfad961","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47526.14545480955348978.6df932ed-6670-40c9-9a84-fc164557d4ec.a574158a-288b-409c-a7c0-de66b535646c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30467.14545480955348978.6df932ed-6670-40c9-9a84-fc164557d4ec.d70564c2-bc2d-4cfc-aaa5-c1fddec8ea41","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.838.14545480955348978.6df932ed-6670-40c9-9a84-fc164557d4ec.0eb70320-beb6-4257-b2f5-9c36734003d4","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13088.14545480955348978.6df932ed-6670-40c9-9a84-fc164557d4ec.f1ab8f76-b647-48a4-84be-1293f18173bc","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24841.14545480955348978.6df932ed-6670-40c9-9a84-fc164557d4ec.8897c51c-f795-4879-8231-a15166830203","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36099.14545480955348978.6df932ed-6670-40c9-9a84-fc164557d4ec.60c41f8d-b0cf-42e8-b98c-a71ae6137de9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39595.14545480955348978.20836daa-93a0-411d-bdd5-b979d2fffcaa.af621b8a-d7c7-4775-823d-a33ba9765c8c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3872.14545480955348978.20836daa-93a0-411d-bdd5-b979d2fffcaa.0c441121-6b7a-4577-871e-60d924ffebb2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4396.14545480955348978.20836daa-93a0-411d-bdd5-b979d2fffcaa.b2dc91ce-6a43-4c09-ad8b-83c67949a2b8","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64302.14545480955348978.20836daa-93a0-411d-bdd5-b979d2fffcaa.25768bcf-7f93-4251-bab3-138b369c778c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63042.14545480955348978.20836daa-93a0-411d-bdd5-b979d2fffcaa.dde9362a-56e3-47c8-a503-bc4cfc8ea462","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23569.14545480955348978.20836daa-93a0-411d-bdd5-b979d2fffcaa.7d8aa78b-7e85-4874-9e58-e37d27d69f12","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4227.14545480955348978.20836daa-93a0-411d-bdd5-b979d2fffcaa.07282712-3d74-4b64-916b-536fdc42fefb","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48975.14545480955348978.20836daa-93a0-411d-bdd5-b979d2fffcaa.1b52e5b1-aed8-4cda-9f9a-4c002a7bcaeb","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60228.14545480955348978.20836daa-93a0-411d-bdd5-b979d2fffcaa.c94eb91e-6f7a-4654-b190-9a4bf8ee7ff2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17133.14545480955348978.20836daa-93a0-411d-bdd5-b979d2fffcaa.42a3eb1f-2874-457e-973c-635b3e128230","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4227.14545480955348978.20836daa-93a0-411d-bdd5-b979d2fffcaa.07282712-3d74-4b64-916b-536fdc42fefb","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48975.14545480955348978.20836daa-93a0-411d-bdd5-b979d2fffcaa.1b52e5b1-aed8-4cda-9f9a-4c002a7bcaeb","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60228.14545480955348978.20836daa-93a0-411d-bdd5-b979d2fffcaa.c94eb91e-6f7a-4654-b190-9a4bf8ee7ff2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17133.14545480955348978.20836daa-93a0-411d-bdd5-b979d2fffcaa.42a3eb1f-2874-457e-973c-635b3e128230"],"ReleaseDate":5250047846427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":97113624576},"MetacriticPlatform":null,"AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{},"MetaScore":{},"ID":"9P686C1GJ91L","Title":{"en":"ARK: Ultimate Survivor Edition"},"Description":{"en":"Experience everything that the ARK franchise has to offer in this definitive collection!

Brace your loins with up to four players to run ‘n’ gun as dozens of different bros and eliminate the opposing terrorist forces that threaten our way of life.\r\n\r\n*** Broforce Forever Update ***\r\n\r\nBroforce Forever, the long-awaited free update to 2015’s most patriotic video game, held back from freedom-loving gamers for a crime it didn’t commit, has promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade and unleashes a megaton of Kentucky-fried carnage into the face of evil.\r\n\r\nThe final update offers an improved and expanded campaign with new unlocks, along with six new ultra patriotic bros, four new democracy-spreading challenge levels, and the ultimate expression of military might – bug fixes!\r\n\r\nThe best way for a returning player to enjoy this is to play through the entire campaign again. And again. Forever.\r\n\r\nNEW BROS\r\nHarness the calculating intelligence and acid-spitting allure of Seth Brondle, wield Xebro’s flying Chakram, serenade (and grenade) terrorism with the flamenco firebrand Desperabro, or become the thing monsters have nightmares about, a stake throwing, unholy purging, self-resurrecting teenage Slayer!\r\n\r\nIf sniping is more your style, famed bug hunter Bro Gummer brings pinpoint liberation with his trusty rifle, while Demolition Bro’s Freeze Grenades put evildoers right back where they belong… ON ICE.\r\n\r\nNEW BADDIES\r\nA Bro only becomes a force when confronted with those who seek to destroy their freedoms, and in Broforce Forever, the terrorists are even more determined to delete democracy. Motorbike Maniacs will try to run you down, while machine gun placements, barbed wire, sandbags and bazooka-laden blimps conspire to make each visit to occupied territory a very, very bad day at the broffice.\r\n\r\nNEW CHALLENGES\r\nBros in search of even bigger battles can flex their muscles in new challenge levels known as Muscle Temples. Each campaign tasks Indiana Brones with navigating a perilous temple that features a new Threat Level and specific enemy types and hazards. Succeed and unlock one of four new flexes that can be deployed by any Bro, any time, any place.

Design, build, and manage the city of your dreams, from public services to civic policies, and challenge yourself to grow from a simple town to a bustling metropolitan hub.\r\n\r\nCities: Skylines is an award-winning, best-selling management game, now available for Windows 10 with all of its robust city-simulation gameplay and unique charm along for the ride. The Windows 10 Edition includes the base game and the popular After Dark expansion, allowing players to plan and design for their cities’ nightlife and tourist attractions.\r\n\r\nMain Features:\r\n- Build the city of your dreams: Plan road networks, bus lines and parks. Bring on a smog-filled industrial revolution or create a quiet beach town ideal for tourists powered by renewable energy. Bring education, healthcare and safety to your citizens. Build it your way!\r\n\r\n- Multi-tiered and challenging simulation: Playing as the mayor of your city, you’ll be faced with balancing essential requirements such as education, water electricity, police, firefighting, healthcare and much more, along with your city’s economy. Citizens within your city react fluidly, keeping you on your toes with ever-evolving demands.\r\n\r\n- Extensive local traffic simulation: Managing traffic and the needs of your citizens to work and play will require the use of several interactive transport systems – use careful road planning alongside buses, trains, subways, and much more.\r\n\r\n- Districts and policies: Be more than just another city hall official! Create a car-free downtown area, assign free public transport to your waterfront, or ban pets in suburbia. Designate parts of your city as a district in order to set policy at the local level, and give different parts of town their own personalities.\r\n\r\n- After Dark included: Watch your city become an entirely different place at night: a day-night cycle will have your citizens seeking out places to unwind after work. Add in new policies and zones to create popular hotspots and provide enough taxis and trains to get to and from the clubs!\r\n"},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"cities-skylines---windows-10-edition","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38447.14442149246756025.e0e6c583-8325-415d-813c-e90e0ab7057a.309e5a51-4e69-41a1-8d19-d19c72140230","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":false,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5247993506427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":17274967293},"MetacriticPlatform":null,"AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Simulation"],"MetacriticUrls":{},"MetaScore":{},"ID":"9PGZ346PSLN0","Title":{"en":"Cities: Skylines II - PC Edition"},"Description":{"en":"If you can dream it, you can build it.\r\nRaise a city from the ground up and transform it into the thriving metropolis only you can imagine.

Choose your noble house and lead your dynasty to greatness in a Middle Ages epic that spans generations. War is but one of many tools to establish your reign, as real strategy requires expert diplomatic skill, mastery of your realm, and true cunning. Crusader Kings III continues the popular series made by Paradox Development Studio, featuring the widely acclaimed marriage of immersive grand strategy and deep, dramatic medieval roleplaying. \r\n\r\n\r\nA bloodline begins\r\n  \r\n• Take command of your house and expand your dynasty through a meticulously researched Middle Ages. Begin in 867 or 1066 and claim lands, titles, and vassals to secure a realm worthy of your royal blood. Your death is only a footnote as your lineage continues with new playable heirs, either planned… or not. \r\n• Discover a sprawling simulated world teeming with peasants and knights, courtiers, spies, knaves and jesters, and secret love affairs. An extensive cast of historical characters can be romanced, betrayed, executed, or subtly influenced.  \r\n• Explore a vast medieval map stretching from the snowswept Nordic lands to the Horn of Africa, and the British Isles in the west to the exotic riches of Burma in the east. Claim, conquer, and rule thousands of unique counties, duchies, kingdoms, and empires. \r\n\r\n\r\nLarger than life \r\n\r\n• Each character is larger than life, with traits and lifestyle choices determining their actions and schemes. Prompt fear and dread as you rule with an iron fist, or inspire your subjects with magnanimous deeds. Genetics can be passed along to your children, be it the gift of genius or crippling stupidity. \r\n• Groom your heir with the appropriate guardians or educate them yourself. If found wanting, marry them off or despatch them through other means. \r\n• Customize your ruler and noble house, from appearance to attributes, and create a monarch worthy of all their inherited virtues and vices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReal strategy requires cunning\r\n\r\n• Govern an ever-evolving realm and grant titles to whom you see fit - or usurp your liege to claim their crown as your own. Be wary of rivals, from restless serfs to revengeful concubines. \r\n• The shadows stir frequently, and danger lurks around every darkened corner. Recruit agents and other unsavory elements to undermine, blackmail, or murder those who stand in your path. Or be inspired by the bard and ballad, and seduce your way to power and influence.\r\n• Blood will flow. Assemble men-at-arms units and powerful knights. Manage your battlefield tactics and armies. Raid and plunder nearby lands or hire mercenaries and Holy Orders for your major conflicts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccomplish great things\r\n\r\n• Be a pious king to invite the religious powers to your side, or design your own faith as you battle between everlasting fame or eternal damnation.\r\n• Bring novel innovations to your culture and construct mighty castles and bastions to increase the wealth, prestige, and security of your realm. \r\n• The paths to follow are limitless: experience thousands of dynamic events and life-altering decisions tailored to each and every conceivable situation and character. There are countless ways of securing and keeping your place in the history books. \r\n\r\n"},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"crusader-kings-iii","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25959.14065406176999862.d433bba3-dfb8-463a-bd60-0c7bd30829d8.8a527e59-eb28-4692-a0cf-f4be29c66f58","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5249031746427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":12864897024},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Shooter"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/crysis-3/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":76},"ID":"9PNRHXZ6ZSS9","Title":{"en":"Crysis 3"},"Description":{"en":"The fate of the world is in your hands.

In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop.\r\n\r\nIF AT FIRST YOU DON’T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN \r\nEvery new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you’ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you’ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted.\r\n\r\nSINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER \r\nAre you the hero or the villain? You’ll experience DEATHLOOP’s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you’ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you’re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna’s stylish sneakers and invade another player’s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign.\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF – PARADISE OR PRISON    \r\nArkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.

A spaceship, mistaken for a supply vessel, was granted access. But when it got close to the base, demons poured out. All your comrades were slaughtered or zombified. This time it's not about survival. It's about revenge.  \r\n\r\nThe Plutonia Experiment Expansion \r\nEvery effort has been made by the nation's top scientists to close the seven interdimensional Gates of Hell, but one portal remains open. Alone, you must infiltrate the ravaged base, defeat the demon Gatekeeper, and seal the last Hell portal before the undead take over the world. \r\n\r\nAdditional Masters Levels \r\nOriginally released as the “Master Levels for DOOM II,” this expansion includes twenty additional levels, all with the same hell-spawned horrors and action of the base game. Each level was created by independent designers and supervised by id Software."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"doom-ii-classic","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18647.14311014949668376.25a6b443-a817-4a82-b4ec-852ef07ef120.0adc334f-0158-4d30-b1e6-3737f2a95621","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56945.14311014949668376.25a6b443-a817-4a82-b4ec-852ef07ef120.06558a11-ba56-4a17-afbb-a74d1957ace4","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31172.14311014949668376.25a6b443-a817-4a82-b4ec-852ef07ef120.aa540653-90cf-45b6-81a8-749b776a39b8","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3894.14311014949668376.25a6b443-a817-4a82-b4ec-852ef07ef120.72d202d2-fbfb-452f-b0ea-01a9a23efbae","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28634.14311014949668376.25a6b443-a817-4a82-b4ec-852ef07ef120.148c6543-ee0c-47e5-ab15-f65dd3817fd9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45960.14311014949668376.25a6b443-a817-4a82-b4ec-852ef07ef120.34056e50-ec1d-43e9-bc96-4e64e79a09b8","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27774.14311014949668376.25a6b443-a817-4a82-b4ec-852ef07ef120.d0cfd094-d6e3-4dca-a8f6-f44af98721e5","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26226.14311014949668376.25a6b443-a817-4a82-b4ec-852ef07ef120.29407800-51a8-478c-85d7-40e7794c79b1","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19488.14311014949668376.25a6b443-a817-4a82-b4ec-852ef07ef120.ecc794cf-8ec9-43f0-a471-e0476b5ce59b"],"ReleaseDate":5248683554427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":442880000},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Other"],"MetacriticUrls":{},"MetaScore":{},"ID":"9N3GDLVDMXG4","Title":{"en":"Dordogne (Windows)"},"Description":{"en":"Immerse yourself in a unique narrative experience, embarking on a vibrant journey that will awaken your senses and evoke warm memories.\r\n\r\nPlay as Mimi, exploring the precious recollections of your childhood and the times shared with your late grandmother.

You are a man named Henry who has retreated from your messy life to work as a fire lookout in the Wyoming wilderness. Perched high atop a mountain, it’s your job to look for smoke and keep the wilderness safe. An especially hot, dry summer has everyone on edge.

Some nay-sayers have called the magnifying glass \"useless\", but what do they know?\r\n\r\nIn Case 1, The Haunted Island, a sloth has been haunted for weeks by a mysterious ghost that nobody can seem to track down. Even after hiring a team of ghost scientists, the mystery is no closer to being solved. Luckily for this tropical sloth, and unluckily for this pesky ghost, Frog Detective is here to crack the case! The Haunted Island is the first in this award-winning series, and this bite-sized mystery is what started an international cult obsession with the world of Frog Detective.\r\n\r\nIn the second mystery, The Case of the Invisible Wizard, we follow the Detective to Warlock Woods, where a celebratory parade for their newest neighbor has been maliciously destroyed. Now the neighbor is nowhere to be seen, and the town is in ruin. Can Frog Detective get to the bottom of things? We sure hope so, otherwise the game would be a bummer.\r\n\r\nIn the exciting series finale, Corruption at Cowboy County, The Detective and Lobster Cop are tasked to solve the conundrum of a sheriff-less town. But not all is as it seems here, when a surprisingly simple solution to the case reveals a sinister scheme. Maybe crime is real after all...\r\nThis final mystery is jam-packed with twists and turns, a true love letter to the Frog Detective fans.\r\n\r\nFrog Detective: The Entire Mystery is a family-friendly yet witty take on the detective game genre. Solve the mysteries on your own, or play along with friends as you take turns reading out the dialogue.

Enough sweet talk, grab your gear, we need you and your squad to defeat the pink pests!\r\n \r\nYOUR MISSION: Liberate Earth from the Alien horde!\r\n\r\nHORDE MODE\r\nWe have an emergency on our hands! Resistance is a high-energy “Horde Mode” where you and your (extremely qualified) team will be deployed into unique locations, completing objectives, while surviving waves of pink life forms that increase in difficulty. It’s down to you to save the world. \r\n \r\nCollect Tokens to unlock weapons, items, and perks to boost your stats and build the ultimate loadout based on your playstyle. Complete formidable missions and extract with your squad to gain well-earned experience to level up your character. Additionally, for those that love to flaunt, you can show off your skill to other players in the session with 26 different ranks to work towards! Get out there and make us proud, recruit! \r\n \r\nSTORY MODE\r\nIt’s time to save the world! Embark on a journey to meet fellow earthlings that require your assistance, you virtuoso. You’ll be completing a wide range of exciting missions, usually, through chaotic combat, and yes, you have full permission to destroy everything in your path. \r\n \r\nMISSION TIP #1: Squad Up!\r\nWhile you can play From Space solo (if you're brave enough) you'd be wise to invite some friends to help you out. With online play you can create a four-person squad. Look, there's a lot of those pink pests out there so the more people, the better. Oh, and with a squad, you'll have some witnessess to tell everyone how awesome you are. It's basically a win-win scenario.\r\n \r\nMISSION TIP #2: Shoot, Explode & Stab\r\nWith a variety of weapons (Rocket Launchers, Miniguns, Flamethrowers and more!) there’s no excuse not to annihilate those aliens! Build your ideal spec and use tactical items such as grenades and mines, or slow down the hordes with barbed wire and machinegun turrets. Remember to scavenge the world for loot, you'll need it!\r\n\r\nMISSION TIP #3: You’re special, so pick your specialist skill!\r\nNo matter what type of player you are, there’s a wide range of characters in From Space's roster, each with their own unique ability and weapons. Find the perfect balance with your friends as you build the ultimate super squad.\r\n \r\nMISSION TIP #4: Don’t just stand there, Level-up!\r\nAs you level-up, you’ll be able to attach special perks to your character, helping you to master the art of destroying aliens. You'll need to find ways to combat increasingly more powerful aliens, and perks will help you accomplish all of your pink alien squashing dreams. Need to rethink your strategy? No problem! We like innovators!

As the leader of possibly the last civilized society on Earth, you’re going to build the city your survivors live in, discover new technologies, explore frozen wastelands and most importantly, manage and rule society to prepare it for life in an unforgiving world. Whether you’re an enlightened ruler or an iron-fisted tyrant, you’ll discover choices in this world aren’t as easy as they seem, and that holding power over people has a cost as heavy as the responsibility you feel in caring for them.\r\n\r\nSHAPE YOUR SOCIETY\r\nEstablish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. \r\n\r\nShould you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless.\r\n\r\nEXPAND AND EXPLORE\r\nSurvival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills.\r\n\r\nWhile New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.\r\n"},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"frostpunk","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60016.14372914980969275.d331a64f-b3f1-4a83-91cf-cb9cce9ce027.2a30409a-59be-488d-9ccb-822b8974b208","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5248287770427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":9621059778},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/full-throttle-remastered/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":77},"ID":"9P3ZRGNQVC7D","Title":{"en":"Full Throttle Remastered"},"Description":{"en":"Released by LucasArts in 1995, Full Throttle is a classic graphic adventure game from industry legend Tim Schafer, telling the story of Ben Throttle, the butt-kicking leader of biker gang the Polecats who gets caught up in a tale of Motorcycles, Mayhem, and Murder.\r\n\r\nNow over 20 years later, Full Throttle is back in a remastered edition featuring all new hand-drawn and 3D high-resolution artwork, with remastered audio and music.\r\n\r\n英語版　※日本語字幕には対応しておりません。"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"full-throttle-remastered","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39265.14598891268352765.09cb1dd7-f055-4038-983d-2721763eedbe.0e1db341-dc19-4da2-8a23-cc7a3476ee6b","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35866.14598891268352765.09cb1dd7-f055-4038-983d-2721763eedbe.48fd99e5-da37-462c-9ddf-e14f596c6836","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44002.14598891268352765.09cb1dd7-f055-4038-983d-2721763eedbe.3d606b0c-6502-4722-add0-83ff7e4d5002","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60427.14598891268352765.09cb1dd7-f055-4038-983d-2721763eedbe.a5a58dc2-cdff-436e-b746-03f868bc496c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19206.14598891268352765.09cb1dd7-f055-4038-983d-2721763eedbe.dac4b1fd-4d7b-4fbb-bae0-08178fa38332","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22907.14598891268352765.09cb1dd7-f055-4038-983d-2721763eedbe.d87bfe6d-758c-4e51-b769-b81e3835f54d","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50879.14598891268352765.09cb1dd7-f055-4038-983d-2721763eedbe.d8f6ffb9-6d8d-48c6-8653-63243df78b37"],"ReleaseDate":5249081894427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":5631930368},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Strategy","Simulation","Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/galacticare/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":80},"ID":"9PB14LD018SM","Title":{"en":"Galacticare"},"Description":{"en":"You are the Director of Galacticare; manage your own interstellar healthcare company, and (try to) save the Galaxy!\r\n\r\nGalacticare takes you on a colourful and bizarre journey - from humble beginnings orbiting 23rd-century Earth, to the internal world of an extra-dimensional deity. \r\n\r\nIt’s time to save the galaxy - one patient at a time!\r\n\r\nGalacticare is brought to you by Brightrock Games, the team behind War for the Overworld.

There’s a goat for everyone!\r\n- Or dress up your goat in all kinds of nonsense, from toilet rolls to tea trays.

You no longer have to fantasize about being a goat, your dreams have finally come true! \r\n\r\nGameplay-wise, Goat Simulator is all about causing as much destruction as you possibly can as a goat. It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff.

Hell Let Loose drops you into the action, where you will have to fight across fields, bridges, forests, towns and more war-torn environments! Lumbering tanks will be dominating the battlefield and crucial supply chains fuelling the frontlines, you are essential to the colossal, combined arms warfare. \r\n\r\nTake to the battlefield in this squad-based, 50v50 multiplayer game, and choose one of our 14 roles available within the Command, Infantry, Recon and Armour unit types. Play as an Officer, Spotter, Medic, Tank Commander and more, to experience every aspect of World War II combat. Each role is equipped with different historical weapons, vehicles, and equipment that are intricately detailed, bringing the realism to the brutal and bloody warfare. Unit focussed gameplay is crucial and when done well can command the tide of battle. \r\n\r\nThe combat takes place across huge, to-scale maps, recreated by utilising aerial and satellite imagery of real battle locations  in stunning detail using Unreal Engine 4. These realistic battlefields are divided up into large capture sectors allowing emergent and constantly unique gameplay to evolve between the two forces of fifty players. Work as a team and make continual large scale, tactical decisions as to where to attack or defend.\r\n\r\nManage resources and supplies to call in support, bombing runs, new vehicles, strafing runs and to reinforce strong-points or flank enemies. When a sector is captured, it will generate one of three resources for your team, creating a complex game that will influence your team’s march to victory. Strategy is key to success.\r\n\r\nHell Let Loose is not about kill to death ratios – teamwork is central to gameplay. Communication is essential. Players work together beneath the leadership of Officers and their Commander to take strategic targets on the battlefield and dominate the opposition. In Hell let loose, it’s always better to tackle things as a team.

You’ll see sword-wielding rabbits, dogs with spears, trumpets lodged in bottoms, human-eating snails, and more. Much, much more…\r\n\r\nFIGHT LIKE AN INKULINATI\r\nInkulinati are a legendary group who battle one another on the pages of medieval manuscripts. They fight by drawing Beasts with the Living Ink. Thanks to this magical substance, those creatures come to life and an epic battle ensues.Move your Beasts across the battlefield, perform actions on or with them, make tactical use of obstacles and collect more Living Ink to draw new Beasts which allows you to gain an advantage over your opponent.\r\n\r\nMULTIPLE DEADLY (AND BIZARRE) BEASTS TO UNLOCK\r\nDonkeys playing trumpets with their bottoms, bishop cats vanquishing heretics with prayers, heavy but deadly snails that eat units alive, and more.

But it’s not just the armies that can influence who will win any given duel. Each Battlefield is its own domain, with its own particular dangers that you should watch out for, and opportunities that you can use. You will have to use your wits and adapt your strategy to beat the opposing Inkulinati’s army on each specific Battlefield.\r\n\r\nA SINGLE-PLAYER CAMPAIGN\r\nUncover the mystery and secrets of Inkulinati and face such opponents as Death, Dante Alighieri, and more. Go out into the world and start your adventure!

During your journey you will learn the secret techniques of drawing new Beasts and Inkulinati Hand Actions, allowing you to choose the composition of your army.

Choose from dozens of champion cards to include in your deck, each with a different mechanic inspired by their original League of Legends abilities.\r\nChampions enter the battle as powerful cards, and if you play smart, they level up to become even more epic. Level your champions multiple times in-game, and earn Champion Mastery crests the more you play.\r\n\r\nALWAYS A NEW WAY TO PLAY\r\nEvery champion and ally in the game comes from a region of Runeterra. You have access to cards from nine regions: Demacia, Noxus, Freljord, Piltover & Zaun, Ionia, Targon, Shurima, the Shadow Isles, and Bandle City.\r\nExplore how different champions and regions work together to give you unique advantages against your opponents. Combine, adapt, and experiment with frequent new releases in an always-evolving meta.\r\n\r\nCHOOSE YOUR PATH\r\nIn PvE, each choice you make shapes your journey.

The enemies will get stronger, but so will you—and you’ll discover different endings the more you play.\r\n\r\nPLAY TO WIN, NOT PAY TO WIN\r\nEarn cards for free, or buy exactly what you want with shards and wildcards—you’re in control of your collection, and you’ll never pay for random packs of cards. While there’s always the option to purchase specific champions, you can easily complete your collection without spending a cent.\r\nVictory or defeat, each battle brings experience and progress. Choose which region you explore first and unlock the cards that call to you, changing regions as often as you like. As you advance, you’ll collect new allies, spells, and champions.\r\nOnce a week, you’ll also unlock chests from the Vault.

It may or may not change over time or release as a final product. Purchase only if you are comfortable with the current state of the unfinished game.\r\n\r\nManor Lords is a strategy game that allows you to experience the life of a medieval lord. Grow your starting village into a bustling city, manage resources and production chains, and expand your lands through conquest.\r\n\r\nInspired by the art and architecture of late 14th century Franconia, Manor Lords prioritizes historical accuracy wherever possible, using it to inform gameplay mechanics and visuals alike. Common medieval tropes are avoided in favor of historical accuracy in order to make the world feel more authentic, colorful, and believable.\r\n\r\nORGANIC CITY BUILDING\r\nManor Lords provides a gridless city-building experience with full freedom of placement and rotation. Building mechanics are inspired by the growth of real medieval towns and villages, where major trade routes and the landscape influenced how settlements formed and developed.\r\n\r\n- Spreading outward from a central marketplace, build your residential, commercial, and industrial districts following the natural lay of the land. Establish farms based on soil fertility, position hunting grounds according to animal populations, and ensure access to adequate resource deposits and forests to provide the raw materials needed for growth.\r\n- Assign areas for housing and watch your residents build their homes in accordance with the historical burgage plot system. Each area will be subdivided based on your roads and the allotted space, and homes will scale accordingly.\r\n- Build extensions behind larger homes to generate resources that would not otherwise be available. Homeowners don't just pay taxes – they grow vegetables, raise chickens and goats, and otherwise supply themselves and other townsfolk with essential needs beyond what your managed farms, pastures, and industries can provide.\r\n- Guide your settlements through the unique demands and opportunities of each season, enjoying the bounty brought by spring rains and preparing for the harsh snows of winter.\r\n\r\nRESOURCE MANAGEMENT\r\nFrom boots to barley and hides to honey, Manor Lords features a great variety of goods fitting of the era. Materials need to be transported and processed into finished products through production chains, and you must balance the basic needs of your people against the desire to produce luxury items to ensure happiness, manufacture trade goods for export, or forge arms and armor to aid in your conquests.\r\n\r\n- Resources are littered across the map, encouraging you to expand and establish multiple specialized settlements. Extract valuable ores from your mining colonies, while villages devoted to agriculture, herding, or hunting supply the grains and meats needed to feed your growing populations. Will you spend your hard-earned influence to first acquire a rich source of iron for your smiths, or will you prioritize regions with fertile soil to serve as your breadbasket? \r\n- Unchecked expansion will have a direct effect on the environment. Herds of deer will migrate away from encroaching civilization, lack of crop rotation will worsen soil fertility, and cutting down too many trees will result in deforestation.\r\n- Establish trade routes and sell surplus goods to traveling merchants to enrich your population. Manufacturing and exporting a variety of goods will provide wealth with which to upgrade your peoples’ homes, import goods you can’t produce yourself, and through taxes on said wealth, fill your own coffers.\r\n\r\nMEDIEVAL WARFARE\r\nYours is but a small parcel of land in a vast territory, and the competing ambitions between you and rival lords will inevitably lead to conflict. Lead your people into battle, not as expendable units to be easily replenished, but as your beloved loyal subjects where every death is a cost worth considering.\r\n\r\n- Train a retinue of skilled warriors to fight battles alongside the levies you raise from the town militia. At times these soldiers will be needed to suppress banditry, and at other times you will lead your men into battle to conquer or defend territory. When needed, mercenaries are a costly option to bolster your ranks. Will you raise the militia at the first sign of trouble, bringing your economy to a stand-still as your peasants pick up arms and rush to form ranks, or will you spend your personal wealth to hire bands of sellswords instead?\r\n- Command real-time tactical battles, taking into consideration fatigue, weather conditions, and equipment. Position your troops wisely – a smaller force can defeat a larger enemy, if commanded well.\r\n- Feel the cost of battle, even in victory, as each fallen soldier represents a lost person from your city.\r\n\r\nHAND CRAFTED\r\nThis game is a passion project started by a solo developer.

Is it a plane? It's falling too fast to be either of those. It's McPixel! A wanna-be hero who keeps getting mixed up in the most unbelievable situations you can imagine.\r\n\r\nLevels\r\nOne moment you're stuck in a speeding train headed towards the cliff; the other, you're in a falling plane. Sometimes you need to win an impossible-to-win soccer match, and the other, you're a dinosaur trying to hide from a meteorite. Stuck in a flaming house? Sandwiched between two battling armies? Certainly not a problem for McPixel! 100 levels of fast-paced action are waiting for you!\r\n\r\nMinigames\r\nSometimes, the usual adventure style will get interrupted by genre-bending minigames. Ranging from racing, shooting, fighting, and sports to even platforming or FPS! The game offers over 20 minigames scattered around the world of McPixel!\r\n\r\nCoins and stamps\r\nMcPixel is not all about just saving the day but having fun trying to come up with the craziest possible solutions. And for every solution, you will be rewarded with coins! Find all solutions in a level to get the gold prize and some extra coins! You can use them to unlock new levels! Also, everyone loves coins, right? They're shiny and golden and spinning! No reason not to have some more!\r\n\r\nMcBurg\r\nThe game takes place in the city of McBurg. Explore the city and find different adventures! Some of the paths in the city are blocked and will require you to spend coins to move forward and access new levels! The city will get populated with characters and items from the levels you already visited as you play. You will also be able to don some of the costumes you found while playing.\r\n\r\nOn the edge of the city upon a grassy hill, you can see a Devolver vault, full of gold, looming over McBurg. So, if you ever need a lot of coins, maybe it's time to pay Fork Parker a visit?\r\n\r\nSteve\r\nSometimes, during your adventures, you will find Steve. Steve can be in the weirdest and most unexpected of places, and finding him will transport you to the Steve level.\r\n\r\nSteve is not like McPixel and doesn't specialize in saving the day. He's just some guy, doing stuff. Like fishing, cooking, driving a car, or summoning demons. You know, just the average guy kind of stuff.\r\n\r\nKey Features:\r\n- 100 mind-blowing levels\r\n- Nearly 1000 hilarious gags to discover\r\n- Over 1500 interactive items\r\n- Over 20 minigames in all imaginable genres\r\n- Over 300,000,000 pixels\r\n- Steve\r\n- A water level"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"mcpixel-3","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31201.14336879122555401.4c30f6b3-d0ef-4997-95dd-4b1a894b1874.f4a8090c-17b1-49a4-bfb9-5747db50f016","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27877.14336879122555401.4c30f6b3-d0ef-4997-95dd-4b1a894b1874.93b1ec86-3096-4f4d-a2f7-baedd49e039a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61860.14336879122555401.4c30f6b3-d0ef-4997-95dd-4b1a894b1874.3769b389-61f8-463e-8b3a-2160f73feac8","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31417.14336879122555401.4c30f6b3-d0ef-4997-95dd-4b1a894b1874.92ff14b8-26d8-45ad-ad6f-cad7c6a22a4d","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3719.14336879122555401.4c30f6b3-d0ef-4997-95dd-4b1a894b1874.82120ed7-c554-400c-a6f2-dc631f1a7298","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37772.14336879122555401.4c30f6b3-d0ef-4997-95dd-4b1a894b1874.8b50c834-2689-4953-8aa2-430fc4963fe7","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31668.14336879122555401.4c30f6b3-d0ef-4997-95dd-4b1a894b1874.e8cdd66b-ac67-4a4c-bcba-df485825736f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8592.14336879122555401.4c30f6b3-d0ef-4997-95dd-4b1a894b1874.f7fc8493-9364-46ad-9024-8274ba4f61d7","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25602.14336879122555401.4c30f6b3-d0ef-4997-95dd-4b1a894b1874.a6fcf924-7ab8-4876-9a1c-a17ab0c0572c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7623.14336879122555401.4c30f6b3-d0ef-4997-95dd-4b1a894b1874.d23d19de-1545-41ec-a90e-181fb4e77409","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42048.14336879122555401.4c30f6b3-d0ef-4997-95dd-4b1a894b1874.e8016dfd-4bd0-4e69-8aa8-4a6086055c34"],"ReleaseDate":5249726438427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":157487104},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Shooter","Simulation"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/mechwarrior-5-mercenaries/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":73},"ID":"9PB86W3JK8Z5","Title":{"en":"MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries"},"Description":{"en":"BE YOUR OWN WEAPON OF WAR\r\n\r\nWelcome to the year 3015!

This is because each unit has its own attack types and attack or heal ranges. \r\nSo it's good to care about the position of the unit when you place units in the puzzle part. In addition, you can use swaps to change their position in battle.\r\n\r\n◆UPGRADE SYSTEM\r\nYou can use gold from puzzles and battles to upgrade your base and units in your squad.\r\nBase upgrades provide unlocking the merging list and adding the number of turns, previews, and swap.\r\nUnits upgrades increase the unit's HP and ATK, giving you an advantage in battles.\r\n\r\n◆DEFENSE MODE\r\nSurvive from the endless monsters as long as you can with your squad you've grown.\r\n\r\n◆VERSUS SYSTEM\r\nBrag your puzzle skill in this local multi-player mode.\r\n\r\n◆CHALLENGE MODE\r\nIt's another land only for the challenge mode.

Will you be a fighter, preying on the weak and taking their riches, or taking out pirates for their bounties? Power is yours if you upgrade your ship for speed and weaponry.\r\nOr a trader? Find rich resources on forgotten worlds and exploit them for the highest prices. Invest in more cargo space and you'll reap huge rewards.\r\nOr perhaps an explorer?

Upgrade your engines to jump ever farther, and strengthen your suit for survival in toxic environments that would kill the unwary.\r\n\r\nShare your journey\r\nThe galaxy is a living, breathing place. Trade convoys travel between stars, factions vie for territory, pirates hunt the unwary, and the police are ever watching.

It is subject to change before its release as a finished product. Please purchase only if you are comfortable with the game in its current state.\r\n\r\nQ. What kind of game is this?\r\nA. In this game, you can peacefully live alongside mysterious creatures known as Pals or risk your life to drive off a ruthless poaching syndicate.\r\nPals can be used to fight and breed, or they can be made to work on farms or factories.\r\nYou can even sell them or eat them.\r\n\r\n▼Survival\r\nIn a harsh environment where food is scarce and vicious poachers roam, danger waits around every corner. To survive, you must tread carefully and make difficult choices...even if that means eating your own Pals when the time comes.\r\n\r\n▼Mounts & Exploration\r\nPals can be mounted to traverse the land, sea and sky—allowing you to traverse all kinds of environment as you explore the world.\r\n\r\n▼Building Structures\r\nWant to build a pyramid? Put an army of Pals on the job. There are no labor laws for Pals, so exploit them to your heart's content.\r\n\r\n▼Production\r\nFind a variety of useful Pals to make fire, generate electricity, or mine ore so that you can live a life of comfort.\r\n\r\n▼Farming\r\nSome Pals are good at planting seeds, while others are skilled at watering or harvesting crops. Work together with your Pals to create an idyllic farmstead.\r\n\r\n▼Factories & Automation\r\nLetting Pals do the work is the key to automation. Build a factory, place a Pal in it, and they'll keep working as long as they're fed—until they're dead, that is.\r\n\r\n▼Dungeon Exploration\r\nWith Pals on your side you can tackle even the most dangerous areas. When the time comes, you might have to sacrifice one to save your skin. They'll protect your life—even if it costs their own.\r\n\r\n▼Breeding & Genetics\r\nBreed a Pal and it will inherit the characteristics of its parents. Combine rare pals to create the strongest Pal of them all!\r\n\r\n▼Poaching & Crime\r\nEndangered Pals live in wildlife sanctuaries. Sneak in and capture rare Pals to get rich quick! It's not a crime if you don't get caught, after all.\r\n\r\n▼Multiplayer\r\nMultiplayer is supported, so invite a friend and go on an adventure together! And of course you can battle your friends and trade Pals, too.\r\nNote: PvP will be implemented in a future update\r\n\r\nCollect all kinds of exciting Pals to fight, farm, build, and work for you in this completely new multiplayer, open world survival and crafting game!"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"palworld-game-preview","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64359.13654268679289325.5cd9109c-5095-44b3-a4a2-0bbf822058b7.d23fd29a-8afc-45bf-8ae4-20983e5ea746","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":false,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42368.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.8d70e6c3-3f80-4433-9720-1cbabc621ec6","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61138.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.fd7eb204-dc7f-4107-a237-c191d63a47cd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55732.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.88b644de-dd0d-486c-a3a7-dfd26c3e3b2e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39973.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.2e7d429e-6749-4a77-a51c-c367e73a9175","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5789.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.6c3c163b-0362-457f-b0f6-f62ff9388750","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52925.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.b2e45903-d5d1-4911-983e-efff17ee7277","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30971.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.ca18135b-9f35-40ab-9999-89960a8cb441","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10748.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.6acfb2bc-dfdb-4106-a0ba-82a6489fc51c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14003.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.394a498c-f60b-46e2-9ef0-05af8ea3dc52","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21475.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.34450769-d837-414b-bb16-f1ce8365bf86","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32586.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.d4e1b4d3-e291-4ecf-ad8e-8826a6c4f7f5","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50425.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.7e860136-9e36-441d-9ddb-2740d979e350","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.552.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.947bdcff-d499-408f-bac8-588d12934011","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19747.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.dcf183b3-48fc-4e8a-b584-ee46cb648452","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19681.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.754865e1-b9aa-4df3-b36d-a5458a3184d3","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31947.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.c4515cfc-aa8d-4bb8-b589-1ba8d115edd1","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52814.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.1cecdbba-5931-4c3a-999c-dbc65d1df1a0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.540.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.f0ae85ea-c4ba-4eea-b74e-5fb236c562ad"],"ReleaseDate":5250098498427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":20985618432},"MetacriticPlatform":null,"AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Family & kids","Platformer"],"MetacriticUrls":{},"MetaScore":{},"ID":"9N3TF03KNTBD","Title":{"en":"PAW Patrol Mighty Pups Save Adventure Bay"},"Description":{"en":"A fallen meteor has given the pups mighty powers – and left Adventure Bay in a mighty mess.

Since its release, PAYDAY-players have been reveling in the thrill of a perfectly planned and executed heist. That’s what makes PAYDAY a high-octane, co-op FPS experience without equal.\r\n\r\nStep out of retirement back into the life of crime in the shoes of the Payday Gang, the envy of their peers and the nightmare of law-enforcement wherever they go. Several years after the crew’s reign of terror over Washington DC has ended, they assemble once again to deal with the threat that roused them out of early retirement.\r\n\r\nThe Tightest Crew\r\n\r\nThe legendary Payday Crew, dreaded by the law and underworld alike, is back. Ripped from their peaceful retirement to rejoin the criminal world by a new threat, one born from the chaos the Crew left in their wake.\r\n\r\nIn order to identify and crush this new threat, the Crew is leaving their Washington DC roots behind them and moving to New York City. A new location will bring with it new challenges, but also new opportunities for a heister with a plan.\r\n\r\nGive in to your greed\r\n\r\nGive outlet to your greed and let loose in PAYDAY 3. In addition to gold, cash and jewelry and any other valuables they might come across, you’ll be able to build a sizable collection of weapons, cosmetics and accolades.\r\n\r\nIt won’t be as simple as showing up and gaining goodies. You’ll have to work hard and plan smart to get away with as much loot as possible. Gain experience, unlock new skills and gain proficiency in weapons to steadily grow your power to handle the tougher challenges.\r\n\r\nThe Art of Heisting\r\n\r\nA professional heister knows it takes planning, hard work and a good amount of luck in order to execute a successful heist. In PAYDAY 3 the choice is put in the hands of the players, deciding how to tackle the heist, whether you sneak or go in guns blazing, whether you let your hostages go or keep them around as pawns, whether you go at it alone or bring friends. The choices are endless and in your hands, they will vastly change how the game plays.\r\n\r\nThrive in Co-op\r\n\r\nNot just anyone is worthy of standing at your side for something as important as a heist. Likewise, PAYDAY 3 is best enjoyed with close friends in mind, whether you bring them from your childhood or make them along the road.\r\n\r\nThe PAYDAY-series has always valued the bonds made through hardship and tries to reflect that in the actions and words of our heisters while in the game, and through our community while on the outside.\r\n\r\nAccount with Starbreeze Nebula required to play PAYDAY 3."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"payday-3","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41648.13779457877292855.4803a4b4-94cc-4b12-bf91-ad49bcb0c65c.f14df05b-5717-4af8-a8ab-6201e4159608","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54257.13779457877292855.4803a4b4-94cc-4b12-bf91-ad49bcb0c65c.0c055b53-1d9a-4f03-b4fc-dd316467a5af","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36413.13779457877292855.4803a4b4-94cc-4b12-bf91-ad49bcb0c65c.38b89a08-f322-4890-87f9-8997b485836a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61289.13779457877292855.4803a4b4-94cc-4b12-bf91-ad49bcb0c65c.9dd7499c-c4cd-4d65-8289-ec45686bbd17","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42482.13779457877292855.4803a4b4-94cc-4b12-bf91-ad49bcb0c65c.f5958f4e-ee58-4814-a63c-8b4aec3e4a77"],"ReleaseDate":5249995070427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":64080556032},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Puzzle & trivia"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/peggle/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":85},"ID":"9MVPD3Z5N4QL","Title":{"en":"Peggle®"},"Description":{"en":"Want to be a Peggle Master?

Featuring turn-based tactical combat on procedurally generated maps, and resource management on a global scale, Phoenix Point offers endless replayability and a brutal challenge.\r\n\r\nFollowing a global environmental disaster, the Pandoravirus appeared and began reshaping creatures, including humans, into hideous mutants. Unable to stop the progress of the virus, much of human civilization was wiped out -- only small enclaves remain, separated by their principles and the vast landscape. The Phoenix Project, an ancient failsafe against global catastrophe is the only hope to unite mankind and take back the planet.\r\n\r\nLead the Phoenix Project from its base at Phoenix Point. Research and develop new technologies and techniques, plan operations, build alliances to unite the planet-- or simply destroy your rivals. It's up to you to save the planet and rebuild civilization, but there may be much more to the alien threat than meets the eye.\r\n\r\n* Mutating Alien Menace: Face down an ever-changing alien threat that adapts to your tactics and offers no respite even as your team becomes more powerful and technologically advanced.\r\n\r\n* Uncover the Secrets of the Pandoravirus: Phoenix Point features a complex narrative, with multiple endings that the player can only uncover via multiple playthroughs. Discover a secret history, as you learn about the origins of the mutants, the Pandoravirus, and Phoenix Point itself through exploration, diplomacy, and research.\r\n\r\n* Manage Diplomatic Relations: The Phoenix Project is not the only organization trying to reclaim the Earth. The militaristic New Jericho, the mystical Disciples of Anu, and the technophiles of Synedrion all offer unique rewards for co-operation and threats for opposition. It is up to you to decide how, or even if, to deal with them.\r\n\r\n* Take Aim on the Battlefield: In addition to equipping and commanding units, Phoenix Point lets you take direct control of your soldier's shots in combat, with a unique free-aiming system. Target enemy weakspots, weapons, or valuables, or just go for center mass.\r\n\r\n* Next-Gen Tech with Classic Pedigree: Phoenix Point was designed by Julian Gollop, the creator of the X-COM series in the 1990s. Keeping the core ethos of X-COM while updating the visuals, technology, and systems to modern standards has made Phoenix Point best-in-class."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"phoenix-point","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23750.14507726714197033.ea391b48-d8cb-4724-a6cb-765168bd5161.0029c50b-c234-475e-9928-0185fc83e0aa","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27297.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.8f0d79d4-fb71-4169-bb64-0b77cac69f7f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3522.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.17680a69-6b0d-4293-a53c-6d16fe0035fd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39128.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.c1af4919-7997-458a-ae19-4b9cf83ecfaa","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63541.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.c3d3f2f0-5855-4872-bbdd-720b19605e27","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34869.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.dd0e9d28-4298-463e-98c1-032a9fa45f9c"],"ReleaseDate":5248809122427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":25358311424},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":80},"ID":"C4R4RB3SB1NN","Title":{"en-us":"Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy"},"Description":{"en-us":"The classic courtroom adventure series that has sold over 6.7 million copies worldwide is finally here.

Your destiny is to become a god! But it will not be easy. Not for you, and not for your followers. To become a deity, you must conquer all 25 planets of the system and defeat every other tribe and their shamans. The ultimate struggle will be a difficult one, as you build mystical cities, unleash devastating spells, harness volcanoes and tornadoes, and shape the face of the planet at your will. Remember, your apotheosis awaits!\r\n\r\nIn the third part of the Populous series, you control your shaman and the tribe of her followers in a difficult quest to conquer all 25 planets of a star system and ascend to godhood. For the first time in the series, the world is presented in true 3D, which at the time amazed both the players and the gaming press.The level of control you exert over your followers also takes you to a new level: you can order individuals or groups to perform certain tasks like gathering resources, constructing buildings, or attacking your enemies.\r\n\r\nPopulous: The Beginning takes a slightly different approach from the previous installments of the series but this is not, by any means, a bad thing as it kept the series fresh and innovative. It was a bold move for Bullfrog but the proof exists in the fact that, after all these years Populous 3 is still a great strategy god-game.\r\n\r\n*Conditions and restrictions apply.

You've made it to the surface of Stroggos in one piece and are still able to contact the fleet. The Gravity Well, the Strogg's newest weapon in its arsenal against mankind, is operational. With the fleet trapped around Stroggos, only 5% of ground forces surviving, and that number dwindling by the second, your orders have changed: free your comrades and destroy the Gravity Well. \r\n\r\nPlay the All-New “Call of the Machine” Expansion \r\n\r\nA brand-new Quake II experience from MachineGames consisting of 28 campaign levels and one multiplayer deathmatch map.

Continuing Arkane’s legacy of carefully crafted worlds and immersive sims, Redfall brings the studio’s signature gameplay to this story-driven action shooter.\r\n  \r\nFEATURES:\r\n\r\nUncover the Truth, Take Back Redfall\r\nThe island town of Redfall, Massachusetts, is under siege by a legion of vampires who have blocked out the sun and cut the citizens off from the outside world. Explore the open world and immerse yourself in a deep story campaign as you unravel the mystery behind the vampires’ appearance. Ally with a handful of survivors against the creatures threatening to bleed the town dry.\r\n \r\nSlay Alone or Squad Up\r\nRedfall blends single- and multiplayer options seamlessly, allowing the player to venture into the darkness alone or to squad-up for up to four player co-op. Teammates can try different hero loadouts and combine their strengths to find creative solutions to the vampire apocalypse. You will collect an arsenal of specialized weaponry and customize your character with unique upgrades and abilities to suit your playstyle for guns blazing, stealth combat, and everything in-between.\r\n \r\nUnconventional Heroes Vs. The Night\r\nCreated by science experiments gone wrong and gifted with psychic abilities, Redfall’s vampires will challenge you and your squad to get creative. You will choose from a team of diverse heroes – each with their own character-specific abilities – to overcome the vampire legion and their brood of maniacal followers. \r\n- DEVINDER CROUSLEY – The Verified Cryptid Hunter: A cryptozoologist and aspiring inventor. Armed with weapons of his own creation, he’s on a mission to prove himself.\r\n- LAYLA ELLISON – The Telekinetic Threat: A biomedical engineering student who volunteered for a medical trial where something went very wrong, leaving her with intense telekinetic abilities.\r\n- REMI DE LA ROSA – The Ingenious Ingeniera: A brilliant combat engineer who has spent her life on the frontlines. With the help of her robot cohort, Bribón, she’s determined to help rescue Redfall’s survivors.\r\n- JACOB BOYER – The Deadeye with an Undead Eye: An ex-military sharpshooter turned private contractor.

His true love, Elaine Marley, has turned her focus away from governing and Guybrush himself is adrift and unfulfilled, having never found the Secret of Monkey Island. Hip, young pirate leaders led by Captain Madison have shuffled the old guard from power, Melee Island has taken a turn for the worse, and famed businessman Stan has been imprisoned for ‘marketing-related crimes’.\r\n\r\nBanter with old friends and new faces on familiar islands now under dangerous new leadership. Then, take to the high seas and explore the new and unknown as you work your way out of tough predicaments. Clever puzzles, bizarre situations, and devastating ripostes are all that stand between Guybrush and glory.\"\r\n\r\nReturn to Point & Click Swashbuckling\r\nBringing classic point-and-click gameplay to the modern-day, intrepid pirates will solve puzzles and explore the islands with a clever evolution of classic adventure game controls. Context-sensitive interactions, reactive dialog trees, and an easy-to-use inventory system make pirating a breeze.\r\n\r\nEmbark on Archipelago Adventures\r\nNavigate the sometimes-friendly confines of Melee Island, a familiar place that finds itself under new management by leaders who have put the squeeze on old friends and new faces. Venture out into uncharted lands like the aptly named Terror Island and the chilling outposts of Brrr Muda to make allies and enemies alike.\r\n\r\nCreated by a Legendary Crew\r\nThe new chapter in the Monkey Island series marks the return of the iconic series’ creator Ron Gilbert, joined by game co-writer Dave Grossman, art director Rex Crowle (Knights & Bikes, Tearaway) and composers Peter McConnell, Michael Land, and Clint Bajakian (Monkey Island, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge)."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"return-to-monkey-island","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32947.14176324986442763.11fa95be-f98f-4be1-a416-9571cd1286df.80a3abd4-c71c-4e0a-88a9-1c8542fbd318","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62602.14176324986442763.a35026f0-f7f8-4b8f-8be0-13b4f65221ec.06002ae9-6fc7-4b42-a7ac-bfbcdb38c563","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24519.14176324986442763.a35026f0-f7f8-4b8f-8be0-13b4f65221ec.8d35c788-f2d4-4755-bf08-cb4d21ea2bbf","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40965.14176324986442763.a35026f0-f7f8-4b8f-8be0-13b4f65221ec.77f2967d-9f1f-43a6-8141-7e0f4a5b593c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46451.14176324986442763.a35026f0-f7f8-4b8f-8be0-13b4f65221ec.03cc23b3-54aa-41ce-acee-415b947eeb0b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52652.14176324986442763.a35026f0-f7f8-4b8f-8be0-13b4f65221ec.f1eb267b-9dfa-4861-bba8-df81be0bf125","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62801.14176324986442763.a35026f0-f7f8-4b8f-8be0-13b4f65221ec.b7e22e65-107f-4a44-ac63-543af4a1c947","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58114.14176324986442763.a35026f0-f7f8-4b8f-8be0-13b4f65221ec.1546a1a7-4703-4de0-a8e0-998ed53a00c8","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51479.14176324986442763.a35026f0-f7f8-4b8f-8be0-13b4f65221ec.88c14ee4-e9df-4d85-ad48-5a33d08fd43d"],"ReleaseDate":5249721254427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":4938948608},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Simulation","Strategy"],"MetacriticUrls":{},"MetaScore":{},"ID":"9NS84HCWZD8B","Title":{"en":"Rise of Nations: Extended Edition"},"Description":{"en":"10/10 “Best real time strategy game ever” – MAXIMUM PC\r\n93% “Big Huge Games delivers a sensational strategy game” – PC GAMER\r\n89 METACRITIC.COM\r\n\r\nPC Game of the Year \r\n  - Gamespot.com, 2003\r\n\r\nStrategy Game of the Year \r\n  - Game-Revolution.com, 2003\r\n  - Gamespy.com, 2003\r\n  - TechTV, 2003\r\n\r\nTHE ENTIRE SPAN OF HUMAN HISTORY IS IN YOUR HANDS, IN THIS “GAME OF THE YEAR” WINNING FRANCHISE\r\n\r\nThe Extended Edition Includes:\r\n  - Rise of Nations Original \r\n  - Rise of Nations: Thrones and Patriots – The Expansion for the PC Game of the Year\r\n\r\nJoin the over 2 million Rise of Nations fans.

As Robin, you’ll fight, hunt, craft, steal, and of course help the local people thrive to spite the Sheriff of Nottingham and his ruthless regime – all within an open-world environment that can be freely explored.\r\n\r\nRobin Hood is a famous hero of medieval English folk tales, believed to have during that time roamed the forests of Sherwood with his band of loyal outlaw companions. In the game you’re going to meet those legendary characters as well, such as Lady Marian, Little John, Friar Tuck, Allan-a-Dale, and Will Scarlet.\r\n\r\nRobin's main goal is to help a fledgling community of refugees and rebels advance and expand. Starting with what could be described as a small forest settlement, with a bit of care, hard work, and good luck, it can end up as a town full of people. Recruit local peasants, rebels on the run from the law, and even the citizens and guards of Nottingham themselves as your new outlaw settlers.\r\n\r\nYou start your adventure with building a forest camp, which can soon be expanded following the arrival of new residents. You will be responsible for properly managing the space you secured for yourself within Sherwood Forest to build up the village.\r\n\r\nAnother important part of taking care of the settlement will be to manage the community members’ professions and tasks, training them to become craftsmen, hunters, or guards, and to manage the settlement’s resources, either gathering them yourself or stealing them from convoys and noble estates.\r\n\r\nAs Robin's people grow large in number and strong in sword arm, an uprising in Nottingham may just become a reality, ending the Sheriff's tyranny once and for all.\r\nCan Robin Hood and his Merry Men survive and put an end to injustice?

The unsettling environment is a character itself.\r\n\r\nEvery location contains its own theme (story), puzzles and characters that are integral in creating a cohesive world.

Interaction with the world is realistic - objects are picked up with your hands (instead of just floating in midair), machines and instruments are operated by grabbing the controls, etc.\r\n\r\nInventory and ammo management\r\nYour loadout is defined and limited. This plays a big role in keeping the player in an even greater state of awareness throughout the whole game.

Magic has returned to the world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Technology merges with flesh and consciousness. Elves, trolls, orks and dwarves walk among us, while ruthless corporations bleed the world dry. You are a shadowrunner - a mercenary living on the fringes of society, in the shadows of massive corporate arcologies, surviving day-by-day on skill and instinct alone. When the powerful or the desperate need a job done, you get it done... by any means necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the urban sprawl of the Seattle metroplex, the search for a mysterious killer sets you on a trail that leads from the darkest slums to the city’s most powerful megacorps. You will need to tread carefully, enlist the aid of other runners, and master powerful forces of technology and magic in order to emerge from the shadows of Seattle unscathed.\r\n\r\nThe unique cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation over 30 years ago. Return to the world of Shadowrun, with this cult-classic turn-based tactical RPG.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\nGripping Tactical Combat: When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With the variety of weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices. A successful run requires commanding a team of runners with the right balance of combat, tech, and magical abilities.\r\n\r\nSkill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun Returns’ classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose. Want to start summoning spirits as an ork Shaman and evolve into a cybered-up weapon specialist? Do it!\r\n\r\nEngaging 2D/3D Art Style: Shadowrun Returns mixes dynamic 3D characters and lighting with a vibrant, hand-painted environment.

Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall.\r\n\r\nIt’s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge’s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the “Flux State” controls the city of Berlin. It’s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there’s no better place to earn a quick payday.\r\n\r\nNow, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return…\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\nA Classic, Story-Driven cRPG: Dragonfall hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG’s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development.

The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. But it’s not all about the mission - each team member also has challenges to face in their own lives, which you can choose to brush aside or play an important part in.\r\n\r\nGripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat: When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters.

Fight your way across the most immersive maps yet, with many real-world locations captured in stunning detail, and an improved traversal system that lets you explore more of them than ever before.\r\nFrance, 1944 – As part of a covert US Rangers operation to weaken the Atlantikwall fortifications along the coast of Brittany, elite marksman Karl Fairburne makes contact with the French Resistance. Soon they uncover a secret Nazi project that threatens to end the war before the Allies can even invade Europe: Operation Kraken.\r\n\r\nEXPANSIVE CAMPAIGN\r\nMany real-world locations have been captured using photogrammetry to recreate a living, immersive environment, and multiple infiltration and extraction points and kill list targets provide a whole new perspective on each mission. Take on the Nazi plot solo or work with a partner, with improved co-op mechanics allowing you to share ammo and items, give orders and heal each other.\r\n\r\nADVANCED GUNPLAY PHYSICS AND TRAVERSAL\r\nUse ziplines, slide down slopes and shimmy along ledges to reach the perfect vantage point, or to sneak past a sharp-eyed lookout. Factor in rifle stock and barrel options along with gravity, wind and heart rate while you line up your sights on the target.\r\n\r\nHIGH CALIBRE CUSTOMISATION\r\nUse workbenches to customise and upgrade virtually every aspect of your weapon – change scopes, stocks, barrels, magazines and more. Rifles, secondaries and pistols all have a huge variety of options. On top of that you can select the ammo to suit your target, from armour-piercing right down to non-lethal.\r\n\r\nINVASION MODE – CAMPAIGN DROP IN PvP AND CO-OP\r\nInvade another player’s Campaign as an Axis sniper and engage in a deadly game of cat and mouse, providing a new dimension to the challenge as you stalk your prey. Alternatively, as Karl you can call for assistance and have a second sniper drop in to help you out of a tricky situation.\r\n\r\nTENSE ADVERSIAL MULTIPLAYER\r\nCustomise your character and loadout and earn XP, medals and ribbons as you take on intensely competitive 16 player battles that will really test your sharpshooting skills. If co-op’s more your style, you can team up with up to 3 other players against waves of enemies in Survival mode.\r\n\r\nENHANCED KILL CAM\r\nMore realistic and grisly than ever, the trademark X-ray kill cam returns, showing you the true destructive power of each shot. Bones deflect bullets unpredictably, ripping a new path through enemy bodies. SMGs and pistols can also trigger kill cams, including multiple shots in dramatic slow motion.\r\n"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"sniper-elite-5","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34732.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.d7d5968f-4e09-4b2b-aea5-ea36b059cec1","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6211.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.933990f6-2efb-402c-b356-0a6256808dc6","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44790.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.d343893e-b214-4c48-a6ec-9e91c5857981","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2551.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.72068546-cd69-44e2-bd9e-06597bf3156b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40463.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.b46a49fc-a3e6-461e-bef9-19716df95233","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39524.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.1d7a605d-51ad-4988-809f-e37986e430d0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22655.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.72fff174-717c-4b40-8672-d8c553e93ab9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51794.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.9449b6b4-d011-462b-a8a8-cd04cf890bee","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18234.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.918d17fd-7f13-4e22-858c-51a6a3217f45","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26546.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.d30a9588-c4f9-4220-9c10-89f2dab0241c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33660.14329012547000484.7cb39222-264a-4c98-a0f1-007c4e95f1e1.f7433785-db79-48fb-aa7c-980c845f240d"],"ReleaseDate":5249577218427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":56918753280},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Simulation"],"MetacriticUrls":{},"MetaScore":{},"ID":"9NP6WL1XQDBW","Title":{"en":"SnowRunner (Windows 10)"},"Description":{"en":"Get ready for the next-generation off-road experience! \r\n\r\nSnowRunner puts you in the driver’s seat of powerful vehicles as you conquer extreme open environments with the most advanced terrain simulation ever.

Players build space ships, wheeled vehicles, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and uses (civil and military), pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive. Featuring both creative and survival modes, there is no limit to what can be built, utilized and explored.\r\n\r\nSpace Engineers features a realistic, volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. The game can be played either in single or multiplayer modes.\r\n\r\nVolumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity.\r\n\r\nSpace Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn't use technologies that wouldn't be feasible in the near future.\r\n\r\nSpace Engineers concentrates on construction and exploration aspects, but can be played as a survival shooter as well. We expect players will avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications to survive in space and on planets.

Who the heck are you?! Can you see me? You CAN, can't you? You've drunk the Spirittea and now you can see me!! Look, we've got problems! This town is crawling with troublemaking spirits. They've become lost because humans have stopped worshipping, leaving offerings or even thinking about them anymore.\r\n\r\nThis is- well... used to be a nice town, but there have been some strange goings-on lately! You're going to find the spirits causing mayhem and fix their problems so they can become paying customers, and get to know the townspeople and explore the mountain to its fullest!\r\n\r\nHere's the stuff you'll want to get involved in:\r\n\r\n-Solving the spirit's problems - To remember themselves, they'll need anything from some spicy noodles to finding and digging up their lost treasures, so get your problem-solving hat on!\r\n-Making friends with the locals - The townspeople all have their own schedules, likes, dislikes and hobbies to take part in - from bug catching to karaoke, there's something for everyone!\r\n-Managing the bathhouse - You'll need to clean towels, chop wood to heat the baths and seat the spirits with their friends for the ultimate bathing experience.\r\n-Upgrading and decorating - The local shops can make a whole lot of cool furniture and help you fix up overgrown areas of the bathhouse. We should make it big and fancy enough to take on all the spirits!\r\n\r\nTHE BATHHOUSE\r\n\r\nThe bathhouse is an ancient spirit building hidden up in the mountain, and it's up to you to clean it up and fill it full of customers! Once the spirits are in the bathhouse, you'll need to clean towels, chop wood to heat the baths and seat the spirits with their friends for the ultimate bathing experience. Each spirit has their own preferences so you'll need to get to know them all and upgrade the bathhouse to become the best bathhouse keeper around.\r\n\r\nTo keep your bathhouse running, you'll need to:\r\n-Keep the bathhouse and towels clean - Grab your trusty broom to sweep away the cobwebs and collect up all your towels, you'll need to keep everything clean, dry and organised.\r\n-Deliver a five-star service with food and scrubbing - Get ready to pamper your spirits with food straight from your kitchen and a give them a good scrub while they're relaxing! \r\n-Make the water perfect for each spirit - Chop wood for the boilers to heat up the water to the perfect temperature and mix up various elixirs to make the water perfect for each spirit - they'll all have their preferences and favourite recipes!\r\n-Sit friends together and enemies apart - Every spirit has others they like best, as well as some they don't enjoy spending time with at all! You'll have to plan carefully when you lead spirits to their baths - don't seat just anyone together! Unless, of course, you don't care about making money.  Which I do.

This narratively-driven single player game puts you in the role of a Jedi Padawan who narrowly escaped the purge of Order 66 following the events of Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith. On a quest to rebuild the Jedi Order, you must pick up the pieces of your shattered past to complete your training, develop new powerful Force abilities, and master the art of the iconic lightsaber - all while staying one step ahead of the Empire and its deadly Inquisitors. \r\n\r\nWhile mastering your abilities, players will engage in cinematically-charged lightsaber and Force combat designed to deliver the kind of intense STAR WARS lightsaber battles as seen in the films. Players will need to approach enemies strategically, sizing up strengths and weaknesses while cleverly utilizing your Jedi training to overcome your opponents and solve the mysteries that lay in your path. \r\n\r\nSTAR WARS fans will recognize iconic locations, weapons, gear, and enemies while also meeting a roster of fresh characters, locations, creatures, droids and adversaries new to STAR WARS. As part of this authentic STAR WARS story, fans will delve into a galaxy recently seized by the Empire.

Aided by a former Jedi Knight, a cantankerous pilot, and a fearless droid, you must escape the evil machinations of the Empire in a story-driven adventure. Explore and overcome a wide range of challenges focused on combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. \r\n\r\n● The Galaxy Awaits - Ancient forests, windswept rock faces, and haunted jungles are all unique biomes you’ll explore in Jedi: Fallen Order, with the freedom to decide when and where you go next. As you unlock new powers and abilities, opportunities open up to re-traverse maps in new ways; leveraging the Force to augment the way you explore. Move quickly, however, as the Empire is actively hunting your every step in their effort to exterminate all remnants of the Jedi Order.\r\n\r\nConditions and restrictions apply.

It may or may not change over time or release as a final product. Purchase only if you are comfortable with the current state of the unfinished game.\r\n\r\nAn extraterrestrial probe is detected approaching Earth. Unknown to humanity, an alien force has arrived in the far reaches of the icy Kuiper Belt and has begun mining a dwarf planet to prepare for an invasion.\r\n\r\nWith Earth’s nations unable to unite to address the alien arrival, transnational groups of like-minded political, military, and scientific leaders develop covert channels to coordinate a response. With the aliens' motives uncertain, factions emerge, driven by hope, fear, or greed.\r\n\r\nYou will control one of these factions;\r\n- The Resistance works to form an alliance of nations to mount a coordinated defense\r\n- Humanity First vows to exterminate the aliens alongside any who sympathize with them\r\n- The Servants worship the aliens and believe they will solve all the troubles of the world\r\n- The Protectorate advocates negotiated surrender as the only means to avoid annihilation\r\n- The Academy hopes the alien arrival heralds the opportunity to form an interstellar alliance\r\n- The Initiative seeks to profit from the chaos and destruction\r\n- Project Exodus plans to build a massive starship and flee the Solar System\r\n\r\nINVESTIGATE THE ALIEN THREAT\r\nA distant anomaly, a mysterious crash site, and a spike in reported disappearances. Could this truly be humanity's first contact with extraterrestrial lifeforms? As your field agents investigate sightings and your scientists race to explore new fields of research, you will slowly learn the truth behind the alien arrival.\r\n\r\n- From early sightings and UFO crash sites to rampaging alien megafauna and robotic armies, it will rapidly become clear that the other six human factions are not your sole competition. Throughout the game, illustrated events will present you with difficult choices as you investigate growing alien activity on Earth. Uncover the mystery of the aliens’ origins and motives – unless, of course, you are Humanity First, and all that matters to you is extermination.\r\n- Terra Invicta has a global research system that creates opportunities for both competition and cooperation. Shared scientific advancement unlocks private engineering projects. Factions can choose to focus on private projects, at the cost of weakening Earth as a whole and ceding influence over global research direction to other factions with different priorities. Left unchecked, factions like the Servants or the Initiative may steer the world’s efforts toward developing methods of social control, rather than propulsion or weapon systems.\r\n\r\nCOMPETE FOR CONTROL\r\nYou begin on Earth as the head of a shadowy organization devoted to your chosen ideology. The aliens are coming – soon – but your first enemies (and perhaps allies) will be other human factions.\r\n\r\n- Lead a faction united by ideology, rather than a nation defined by territory. This is a stark change from most strategy games – in Terra Invicta, you will not paint the map with the colors of some chosen nation. Instead you will rule from the shadows and compete with other factions for control points representing a region's military, economic, and political leadership.\r\n- Geopolitics is your sandbox – unite or break apart nations as best serves your ends, while using those under your influence to conduct proxy wars against the other six factions. Earth’s regions are modeled in detail, from educational levels and unrest to GDP and inequality. Gaining command over regions with great monetary wealth and military power can allow you to implement your will on Earth, but the war for the Solar System will not be won without also securing regions containing space launch facilities.\r\n- Enact your will through a council of politicians, scientists, and operatives sent around the world (and even into space). The starting abilities of these councilors will improve through gaining experience and acquiring control over powerful organizations like intelligence agencies or wealthy corporations. A veteran commander may make the perfect choice to lead a tactical team under the council’s direction, while an experienced diplomat works to secure the funding needed to resist the alien invasion.\r\n- Seek out like-minded populations and politicians and take actions to convert followers of opposing ideologies. Public opinion is modeled along multiple axes – the Servants’ alien worship and the Protectorate’s advocacy of negotiated surrender may largely align in terms of support or opposition to the aliens, but events that show the aliens can be defeated have the potential to convince followers of the Protectorate that resistance is a realistic choice.\r\n\r\nEXPAND ACROSS A DYNAMIC SOLAR SYSTEM\r\nTerra Invicta bridges the gap between our modern-day world and the vast interstellar empires of other space strategy games, asking you to take humanity’s first steps in colonizing our Solar System, where over 300 asteroids, moons, and planets in constant motion create an ever-changing strategic map.\r\n\r\n- Take your faction beyond the confines of Earth, building space stations to act as shipyards and fuel depots, constructing mining stations to acquire advanced resources, and establishing bases to serve as research or construction facilities. Terra Invicta zooms into the strategic geography of the Solar System, presenting space not as a series of isolated stars that you order units to move to and from, but rather a rich and varied landscape of asteroids, moons, dwarf planets, gas giants, and other celestial bodies creating texture and tactical opportunities at every turn.\r\n- The expansive map is constantly shifting as celestial bodies orbit the Sun. This means your space stations and forward operating bases are constantly moving as well, forcing you to plan accordingly and adapt to the evolving circumstances – your colonies among the Jovian moons could find that a once-distant alien military outpost or Initiative privateering base has suddenly become a close neighbor.\r\n\r\nHARD SCI-FI MEETS STRATEGY\r\nTerra Invicta explores what might be – how colonies on Mars might function, what plausible engines could power our spaceships, and the nature of how space colonization and warfare might proceed. Players may find themselves establishing a mining base on the asteroid 16 Psyche after noticing it is rich in metals – and then learn that in our world NASA is planning The Psyche Mission for the same reason.\r\n\r\n- Exploring and eventually colonizing space will require access to many resources: water for life support and propellant, metals for manufacturing, fissiles for nuclear drives and weapons, and more. At the start, you’ll have no choice but to acquire such resources on Earth and suffer the high cost of using rockets to escape Earth’s gravity, but over time you’ll increasingly choose to instead rely on asteroid mining and other means of securing local supply.\r\n- Spaceship design in Terra Invicta draws from the best of scientific speculation and hard science fiction. You can design your own ships, selecting from an array of weapons, drives, and other modules to place on a variety of hulls, ensuring each ship has the right mix of fuel capacity, maneuverability, and other capabilities.\r\n- Tactical combat is built around a realistic simulation of Newtonian physics, where momentum and maneuver in 3D space are just as important as the firepower your ships carry. Fire missiles and use point defense cannons to destroy incoming projectiles; build up momentum then swing hard to bring the enemy into your firing arcs; or grapple with the difficult decision to retract radiators and sacrifice heat dissipation to achieve better armor against an incoming enemy barrage.\r\n\r\nBUILT FOR MODS\r\nTerra Invicta is built with modding support in mind, and much of the game is accessible to modders without a coding background. We hope that the Solar System setting and geopolitics simulation will provide a useful framework for modders to realize their own creative visions."},"Affirmations":[],"MetaCriticPathName":"terra-invicta-game-preview","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26227.14128659347127760.611a70ab-c4a0-44f5-bbe1-82cf10127bba.51a68c77-7b40-4ed2-821a-9321dfcd7b72","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":false,"ScreenShots":[],"ReleaseDate":5250150518427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":25169305600},"MetacriticPlatform":null,"AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Classics","Role playing"],"MetacriticUrls":{},"MetaScore":{},"ID":"9PN3VDFTB5HZ","Title":{"en":"The Bard's Tale ARPG : Remastered and Resnarkled"},"Description":{"en":"You are the Bard: a selfish rogue weary of pointless sub-quests and rat-infested cellars.

But this isn’t a joyride! Ali is on an all-important mission to save her family video store from the nasty loan sharks trying to shut their shop down.\r\n\r\nSwindle strangers, pickpocket people, and con commoners across a wacky America of the ‘90s. And – it should go without saying – lie to your mom about all of it. Choose who deserves to be conned and who might need a helping hand. The world is your oyster (and hey, pearls are worth a lot!).\r\n\r\nOne Con Doesn’t Fool All  \r\nCon people your way! Wear disguises, sneak around, eavesdrop on conversations, and learn how to approach each mark. Maybe you think you can make enough cheddar just by pickpocketing.

It’s up to you to outsmart everyone and lockpick everything that stands between you and saving your mom's video store.\r\n\r\nA Coming-of-Age Comedy\r\nIf there’s one surefire way to discover yourself, it’s by setting out on an adventure. Luckily for you, you’ve got the aid of an expert grifter to coach you in the elusive art of charm. But a life of crime is no laughing matter! Not unless you turn on the laugh track and make it a criminally funny sitcom. Get ready to talk your way into deals, hearts, and trouble. And don’t forget to call home every once in a while to check in with your mom. Sure, you might argue with her sometimes (most of the time?), but you’re a teenager - that’s kind of your job!\r\n\r\nThe Weird and Wack 1990s the Way You Remember Them\r\nWhether you were a ‘90s kid or not, this game is brimming with nostalgia. It offers you the perfect opportunity to relive your own awkward high school years, or if you sadly missed out on the ‘90s, finally experience all of the classic teen movies that feel so old and outdated. Plaid, payphones, VHS tapes, and malls – THE BIG CON has got all of the outrageous fads you remember (and some you want to forget) from the 1990s.\r\n\r\nBut most importantly – you can ride the Hormipillar as much as you want!

Butterworth, whilst guiding a troop of tin soldiers to reach their goal. Critically acclaimed for its moving narrative, refined puzzle design, and immersive atmosphere, Tin Hearts is a narrative puzzle adventure where the ghosts of the past emerge to tell a resonating tale of family, love, and compromise.  \r\n\r\nSpanning across four distinctive acts with 50+ puzzles masterfully woven throughout a grand Victorian home, steadily uncover a variety of whimsical inventions with unique abilities to provide a safe route of passage for the tin soldiers to travel. From the meticulous garden, where the soldiers can bounce, glide and soar to their goal, or the inventor’s basement filled with the heights of innovation and technology, each location has an abundance of treasured memories, whilst there are some that would rather be forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn a tragic fable which will see Albert overwhelmed by sorrow and heartache, discover what brilliant minds do when the love for life, and the love for invention, are threatened by life itself. \r\n\r\nSOLVE A TRAIL OF PUZZLES: Set out on an immersive adventure through 50+ lemmings-like puzzles which constantly evolve as you progress. Uncover new routes to your destination each time you play, with multiple ways to solve the intricate puzzles. \r\n\r\nEXPERIENCE A RESONATING TALE: In a multi-layered and heartfelt narrative, told through treasured memories, photographs and hand-written letters, there is much to be uncovered in Tin Hearts. Witness the delicate balance of family with the persistence of work and the exploitative nature of the Guild of Toy Makers as you wander through Alberts life. \r\n\r\nTAKE DIRECT CONTROL: Explore the world through the perspective of the independent and fully controllable Mr Soldier, a Tin Soldier who is able to break rank and scout out the best way to progress, whilst bringing with him an additional layer of discovery throughout the adventure. \r\n\r\nMARVEL AT THE MECHANICAL WONDERS: Unlock the power to control a variety of ground-breaking inventions steadily introduced throughout the game. Manoeuvre toy cannons, trampoline drums, and balloon inflating machines before taking on the electrifying vigour of the power glove, a visionary invention which is truly ahead of its time. \r\n\r\nBECOME A MASTER OF TIME: Pause, fast-forward and rewind time to observe and change the outcome of your actions. With the offer of hints readily available, Tin Hearts provides an accessible and relaxing puzzle-solving experience to complement your journey. \r\n\r\nA POWERFUL, DEEPLY MOVING SOUNDTRACK: Take your time working through the relaxing puzzles whilst indulging in the poignant soundtrack from award-winning composer Matthew Chastney, whose credits include trailers for ‘JOKER’, 'Chernobyl', and 'Bridgerton'.\r\n\r\nFROM THE DEVELOPERS OF FABLE: Tin Hearts is brought to life by former members of the exceptionally talented Lionhead Studios development team, responsible for the critically acclaimed Fable series.\r\n"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"tin-hearts","OriginalPlatforms":[7],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39565.13863817766354324.d0b7376f-2625-4548-96cd-a79d6e667bd2.b23547dd-089f-4119-867a-be52c9054dee","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12212.13863817766354324.d0b7376f-2625-4548-96cd-a79d6e667bd2.ff8a087a-5b0b-4ab7-88d6-7abf8d70429e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50007.13863817766354324.d0b7376f-2625-4548-96cd-a79d6e667bd2.506ba0fd-8a0f-4106-9359-11f7904fc426","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32927.13863817766354324.d0b7376f-2625-4548-96cd-a79d6e667bd2.8600e2d8-7def-4c16-914c-b80e19bbb7eb","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3547.13863817766354324.d0b7376f-2625-4548-96cd-a79d6e667bd2.14ca52c0-2adf-4503-aa07-db4aa063f897","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63261.13863817766354324.d0b7376f-2625-4548-96cd-a79d6e667bd2.fd4dd53c-88db-4e34-8cec-0fe36e401322","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34321.13863817766354324.d0b7376f-2625-4548-96cd-a79d6e667bd2.93bc7274-09c9-4d60-ac02-08af9f0695cb","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33664.13863817766354324.d0b7376f-2625-4548-96cd-a79d6e667bd2.cccee56d-89f6-42a7-8733-9ffd49594642","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1893.13863817766354324.d0b7376f-2625-4548-96cd-a79d6e667bd2.2115107b-7154-4277-8062-1f2018d217c4","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63564.13863817766354324.d0b7376f-2625-4548-96cd-a79d6e667bd2.2c7057ed-1d1e-476b-9169-389bf6c5cbf0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.220.13863817766354324.d0b7376f-2625-4548-96cd-a79d6e667bd2.7c478b8a-672e-4dd6-8816-b7dc79f2c9e2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39330.13863817766354324.d0b7376f-2625-4548-96cd-a79d6e667bd2.23a9e776-0415-466b-ad4b-0b1ee35f8c72"],"ReleaseDate":5249884406427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":13432328192},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Shooter"],"MetacriticUrls":{},"MetaScore":{},"ID":"9NDP79SDLLLH","Title":{"en":"Titanfall® 2: Ultimate Edition"},"Description":{"en":"The best way to jump into one of the most surprising shooters of 2016 is with the Titanfall® 2 Ultimate Edition.

Fresh out of a three-year prison sentence, an older and weathered Kiryu comes to find out that his surrogate daughter, Haruka, has gone missing from the orphanage he looks after. The trail leads him to his old stomping grounds in Kamurocho, where he discovers that she has been struck by a car and now lies in a coma. To make matters worse, Kiryu learns that Haruka now has a son that he must look after. With baby in hand, Kiryu journeys to the seaside town of Onomichi, Hiroshima to unravel the truth about Haruka, her son, and a sinister secret that the Hiroshima yakuza are harboring.\r\n\r\nFrom the unparalleled realism of the new setting of Onomichi, a beautiful, sleepy port town in Hiroshima Prefecture, to the latest evolution of Kamurocho, the biggest red-light district in Tokyo, Yakuza 6 is the ultimate iteration the game's blend of gritty crime story, hyper-explosive combat, and all the vices and distractions those locales have to offer.\r\n\r\nEnter the “Dragon Engine” - Explore the world of Yakuza like never before. Yakuza 6 is the first current-gen Yakuza title that was developed from the ground up for the current-gen hardware, introducing the seedy Japanese underworld with detailed visuals, lifelike animations, a new physics engine, interactive storefronts, seamless transitions and more.\r\n\r\nExplore Kamurocho Reborn and the Scenic Views of Onomichi - The hypnotic lights, opportunistic inhabitants, and hedonistic distractions of Kamurocho look better than ever. Revamped minigames like karaoke, batting cages, darts, hostesses, and the SEGA arcade have been streamlined for maximum pleasure, and new additions like the RIZAP Gym, Cat Café, and Clan Creator are the purrfect distractions after a long night of bashing heads! But it’s also time to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life to play tourist in beautiful Onomichi. This tranquil coastal community is home to plenty of local activities like bar mingling, spearfishing (think action-packed rail shooter … with fish), and more!\r\n\r\nLet the Bodies Hit the Floor - Yakuza 6 Kiryu is a 100% certified badass, so that means he’s a battle-hardened veteran when it comes to the art of street fighting. Although he utilizes one fighting style this time around, you best believe Kiryu hits like a truck. Devastating combos and bone-breaking Heat Actions make a return, but now the Dragon of Dojima can fill up a meter to engage Extreme Heat Mode. When activated, Kiryu glows blue and unleashes heavy-damage combos with his fists or any “tool” that’s close at hand.\r\n\r\nFully Voiced Japanese Audio - For the first time in series history, every line and piece of dialogue is fully voiced in Japanese.
