Safety, security, and secrecy are of the utmost importance… usually.\n\nAfter a catastrophic containment breach, your workplace has become a cosmic battle zone: anomalous entities are on the loose, enemies from other dimensions are invading via portals, and an arcane military sect - known as The Order - is targeting personnel and entities indiscriminately, aiming to seize artifacts and put an end to the chaos.\n\nContainment procedures have failed and help isn’t on the way. Stranded miles beneath the surface, it’s up to you and your fellow scientists to band together, plan your escape, and make this underground complex your new home - for now.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nAbiotic Factor brings a 90’s sci-fi twist and rich character progression to the multiplayer open world survival crafting genre. Up to 6 players can choose their PHDs, build their scientist, gear up, and explore a massive subterranean complex, filled with supernatural artifacts, transdimensional foes, and science experiments gone awry.\n\nSCIENCE MEETS VIOLENCE\nBetween alien threats hunting their next meal, trigger happy soldiers, and the world’s most advanced robotic security forces attacking personnel working overtime, there’s no shortage of danger. As a scientist, fighting isn’t your forte, so you’ll need to put your PHD to work to outwit your opponents: craft ingenious and outlandish tools, weapons and gear, from simple nets and wooden bats to laser-cannons and elaborate traps - everything your big science brain can muster!\n\nMAINTAIN A HEALTHY WORK LIFE BALANCE\nMake yourself at home - you’re here for the long haul. Scavenge resources from vacant offices and empty labs, raid vending machines, and steal company property to build a new base of operations as you explore the facility. When it’s time for a change of scenery, pack up your belongings and move them across the facility using handcarts, forklifts, SUVs, teleporters, and more.\n\nJOIN THE SCIENCE TEAM\nDon your lab coat and earn your PhD: from Plant Geneticist to Defense Analyst and Structural Engineer (and many, many more), each with its own advantages essential to survival. Combine traits and skills, then level up to earn perks and abilities with your fellow scientists to forge a formidable scientific force.\n\nSURVIVE TO SEE YOUR NEXT DAY OFF\nWorking at GATE may have been a dream job, but dying here wasn’t part of your five year plan. Explore this massive underground facility as well as many worlds beyond and take full advantage of the most advanced technology unknown to mankind in this interdimensional sci-fi adventure!"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"abiotic-factor","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":0,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19958.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.61a5398e-bac4-4f45-91d8-ef4de785728e","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46343.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.a61b52ee-06aa-4e0c-b602-a5bbf27c4558","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27039.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.942459a6-5023-44fc-9491-999e56ca3203","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2810.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.b7109e46-a3f0-4b85-a389-7c4e79c9137a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9454.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.90975c2d-2a2d-4662-9dea-a68492fa8fb6","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43055.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.7bd32c91-7bb7-43fe-b3b7-62366c6d11bb","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12394.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.6bb2a335-ff9c-4da6-a0e6-a9d9feecaad2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49557.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.26fad1dd-99b2-40b3-b0f9-2d237da4d783","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8091.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.d4a9bc3c-705e-4d6c-91a9-908c0edd95fa","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39463.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.8d3f76e2-aa69-4631-a27f-c2a38b4a3c39","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48340.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.8cdcb17f-5edb-425c-90ae-4d3ed029924a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46138.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.0a54a222-73fd-421c-ac45-81dd2aa84ca0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30584.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.5f794223-4ed3-4b4b-ba21-866bc8e07a7c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47983.14585229772819603.06d592a4-a006-4f6e-901f-b18fb39d663a.291c13b9-9040-4393-ba46-4019d883ce95"],"ReleaseDate":5250573986427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":4761149440},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Strategy","Simulation"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/against-the-storm/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":91},"ID":"9NRLRJPV4HWL","Title":{"en":"Against the Storm"},"Description":{"en":"You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.\n\nThe wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.\n\nMANAGE A DIVERSE POPULATION OF VILLAGERS\nFoxes, Beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive. Utilize each group's strengths as you balance their varying needs, from housing and culinary preferences to taste in luxuries and recreation. Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?\n\nCITY BUILDER MEETS ROGUELITE\nExperience core city builder gameplay enhanced by roguelite replayability. Build and manage multiple settlements spread out across a large world map, all while collecting valuable meta-progression resources to upgrade the Smoldering City. Feel the pressure of an expectant monarch as the Scorched Queen demands constant progress while recurring Blightstorms pose an inevitable threat to your settlements. Manage your reputation to secure your success at any one settlement before moving on to establish another, constantly seeking new opportunities for growth, taking on unique challenges across multiple biomes, and bracing for the inevitable destruction of everything but the Smoldering City itself. How will you maximize each cycle to not just ensure the best fate for the Smoldering City, but for your career as Viceroy as well?\n\nNEVER THE SAME GAME TWICE\nWith hundreds of gameplay modifiers and five distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin.

Assist options are provided for those seeking a less frustrating experience, and gluttons for punishment can use those same options to make the game even harder."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"another-crabs-treasure","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38043.14077481160620630.1db41d01-0b54-4154-a1e1-f00cf31fab40.24f86361-82bb-4a28-89ae-12b9e3d32c1d","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49050.14077481160620630.1db41d01-0b54-4154-a1e1-f00cf31fab40.f85030c5-f46b-4b5c-97e8-1b9f2feee95f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23003.14077481160620630.1db41d01-0b54-4154-a1e1-f00cf31fab40.bbffbbc2-99ce-44e2-952c-5a489d037273","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51005.14077481160620630.1db41d01-0b54-4154-a1e1-f00cf31fab40.c4b9b188-9a31-4ec6-8354-ea15c1553739","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55934.14077481160620630.1db41d01-0b54-4154-a1e1-f00cf31fab40.6a953fc2-9b69-4319-9718-f411104e692c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60036.14077481160620630.1db41d01-0b54-4154-a1e1-f00cf31fab40.8a5a96f2-db7a-43fc-89f9-0065a411370a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47806.14077481160620630.1db41d01-0b54-4154-a1e1-f00cf31fab40.2205d6c3-0e84-4ab7-976a-cfd1457b5c6d","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52770.14077481160620630.1db41d01-0b54-4154-a1e1-f00cf31fab40.979269d8-6913-4f7e-931e-4463a8607bba","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39834.14077481160620630.1db41d01-0b54-4154-a1e1-f00cf31fab40.4ac74f0a-d3da-495f-a3fe-e8d19c2ef7f7","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50779.14077481160620630.1db41d01-0b54-4154-a1e1-f00cf31fab40.ee437525-4689-4ecf-b2c2-6094b64ed7fa","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.703.14077481160620630.1db41d01-0b54-4154-a1e1-f00cf31fab40.4854a2b3-ff32-4673-927f-a2517b8cc37a"],"ReleaseDate":5250182594427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":5019746304},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-series-x","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/anthem/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-one"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":65},"ID":"BP9JQBJM0FNW","Title":{"en-us":"Anthem™"},"Description":{"en-us":"PERSISTENT INTERNET CONNECTION AND Game Pass Core MEMBERSHIP REQUIRED TO PLAY.

You awake on a mysterious island, your senses overwhelmed by the blinding sunlight and brilliant colors bouncing off every surface around you, the azure waters of a verdant Island lapping at your bare feet. A deep roar echoes from the misty jungle, jolting you into action, and you stand up – not afraid, but intrigued. Are you ready to form a tribe, tame and breed hundreds of species of dinosaurs and other primeval creatures, explore, craft, build, and fight your way to the top of the food-chain? Your new world awaits… step through the looking-glass and join it!\n\nFEATURES\n\nARK: Survival Ascended has completely recreated and redesigned the artwork and worlds of ARK to take advantage of the latest in videogame technology, Unreal Engine 5, using high-end graphics features such as fully dynamic Global Illumination (“Lumen”), so that light bounces realistically off of surfaces and provides realistic reflections, and advanced mesh streaming (“Nanite”) of hundreds of millions of triangles for extreme detail.\n\nAdvanced new physics systems such as dynamic water so that every creature creates waves, ripples, splashes, and bubbles as they move through fluids, and fully interactive physical foliage where every blade of grass, bush, and tree reacts to characters, explosions, projectiles, and physics objects. Knock down a tree, and see it crash into other trees and disturb all the foliage on its way down to smacking into the grass below! Detect an enemy moving sneakily through the grass as it shifts and sways in response to their presence. Demolish a building and watch the pieces break apart realistically, interacting with the grass and water as they fall.\n\nARK: Survival Ascended includes access to all of ARK’s worlds, including Scorched Earth, Aberration, Extinction, ARK Genesis Part 1, ARK Genesis Part 2, and more. The Island, Scorched Earth, Aberration and The Center are released now, Extinction will be released on December 16, with the subsequent expansion worlds to be added at no additional cost on a regular basis.\n\nThe definitive survival experience returns better than ever: design your Survivor, form a tribe, and tame, train, breed & ride dinosaurs within a living ecosystem. Watch your food, water, temperature, and weather patterns. Slowly expand outwards as you harvest, build structures, farm crops, customize your visual designs, and proceed to explore to uncover the true nature of The Island and the worlds beyond. \n\nThorough Quality of Life revamps in every area: redesigned User Interfaces, dynamic navigation for intelligent creature pathfinding, Wild Babies, Photo Mode, new Camera systems, new Map system, Tracking System, new Structures and Items, new Creatures, and much more.\n\nCross-Platform Modding: Download & play new custom content created by players, including new maps, creatures, items, and game modes, through a dedicated mod collection directly within the game! Enjoy an endless stream of new ARK content as the creativity and talent of the community is fully unleashed for the first time ever across gaming platforms!\n\nCross-Platform Multiplayer: form your online tribe across different gaming platforms as you work together to survive and thrive on the ARK!\n\nSupports public online multiplayer for up to 70 players, private-session multiplayer for up to 8 players, and local split-screen for 2 players."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"ark-survival-ascended","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47381.14545480955348978.f72b621c-2a7f-403c-8bd4-126f7310ad33.c2cc3983-f689-401d-9deb-e46cb33271be","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":false,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13472.14545480955348978.6df932ed-6670-40c9-9a84-fc164557d4ec.73c5dcc2-7fdc-4b6a-86c6-9bc138cf2e64","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52851.14545480955348978.6df932ed-6670-40c9-9a84-fc164557d4ec.4912457c-55f6-4a79-bb69-e37d7c44b453","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39566.14545480955348978.6df932ed-6670-40c9-9a84-fc164557d4ec.02028d27-12f2-4022-8bfa-e64e30fd0916","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46978.14545480955348978.6df932ed-6670-40c9-9a84-fc164557d4ec.928c0d98-a24d-4b68-8fed-88148dfad961","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47526.14545480955348978.6df932ed-6670-40c9-9a84-fc164557d4ec.a574158a-288b-409c-a7c0-de66b535646c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30467.14545480955348978.6df932ed-6670-40c9-9a84-fc164557d4ec.d70564c2-bc2d-4cfc-aaa5-c1fddec8ea41","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.838.14545480955348978.6df932ed-6670-40c9-9a84-fc164557d4ec.0eb70320-beb6-4257-b2f5-9c36734003d4","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13088.14545480955348978.6df932ed-6670-40c9-9a84-fc164557d4ec.f1ab8f76-b647-48a4-84be-1293f18173bc","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24841.14545480955348978.6df932ed-6670-40c9-9a84-fc164557d4ec.8897c51c-f795-4879-8231-a15166830203","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36099.14545480955348978.6df932ed-6670-40c9-9a84-fc164557d4ec.60c41f8d-b0cf-42e8-b98c-a71ae6137de9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39595.14545480955348978.20836daa-93a0-411d-bdd5-b979d2fffcaa.af621b8a-d7c7-4775-823d-a33ba9765c8c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3872.14545480955348978.20836daa-93a0-411d-bdd5-b979d2fffcaa.0c441121-6b7a-4577-871e-60d924ffebb2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4396.14545480955348978.20836daa-93a0-411d-bdd5-b979d2fffcaa.b2dc91ce-6a43-4c09-ad8b-83c67949a2b8","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64302.14545480955348978.20836daa-93a0-411d-bdd5-b979d2fffcaa.25768bcf-7f93-4251-bab3-138b369c778c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63042.14545480955348978.20836daa-93a0-411d-bdd5-b979d2fffcaa.dde9362a-56e3-47c8-a503-bc4cfc8ea462","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23569.14545480955348978.20836daa-93a0-411d-bdd5-b979d2fffcaa.7d8aa78b-7e85-4874-9e58-e37d27d69f12","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4227.14545480955348978.20836daa-93a0-411d-bdd5-b979d2fffcaa.07282712-3d74-4b64-916b-536fdc42fefb","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48975.14545480955348978.20836daa-93a0-411d-bdd5-b979d2fffcaa.1b52e5b1-aed8-4cda-9f9a-4c002a7bcaeb","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60228.14545480955348978.20836daa-93a0-411d-bdd5-b979d2fffcaa.c94eb91e-6f7a-4654-b190-9a4bf8ee7ff2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17133.14545480955348978.20836daa-93a0-411d-bdd5-b979d2fffcaa.42a3eb1f-2874-457e-973c-635b3e128230","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17014.14545480955348978.8ab2c972-6a51-4d13-9dee-20fb336ddc09.a751a1ea-e1e7-4628-9bb0-04c98478f5bd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13654.14545480955348978.8ab2c972-6a51-4d13-9dee-20fb336ddc09.d2d81f04-b834-4e98-9708-a5399057a503","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35433.14545480955348978.8ab2c972-6a51-4d13-9dee-20fb336ddc09.533a1b9e-968f-4ba8-8ed4-f85c5f22bda7","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3122.14545480955348978.8ab2c972-6a51-4d13-9dee-20fb336ddc09.437b0c04-4b1a-4b83-99f7-157e7b73252c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21852.14545480955348978.8ab2c972-6a51-4d13-9dee-20fb336ddc09.81f6911e-517e-488b-96a9-946e1227640e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59646.14545480955348978.8ab2c972-6a51-4d13-9dee-20fb336ddc09.34794db9-203e-4f81-a0ea-c267bee495c3","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58499.14545480955348978.8ab2c972-6a51-4d13-9dee-20fb336ddc09.5309fd5a-0944-4e91-bc5d-fc0a68b8eb4b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4728.14545480955348978.8ab2c972-6a51-4d13-9dee-20fb336ddc09.23006668-eea5-4f46-8d5c-900ec205adb2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21848.14545480955348978.8ab2c972-6a51-4d13-9dee-20fb336ddc09.529af9ed-5ef6-460a-a0f9-023a1d48db78","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32464.14545480955348978.8ab2c972-6a51-4d13-9dee-20fb336ddc09.f533b296-d4c5-4546-8b02-f4137a7596f6","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33258.14545480955348978.8ab2c972-6a51-4d13-9dee-20fb336ddc09.337d5277-157b-4273-b8dc-4a2b6c0c02e6","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5173.1454548095534

It's up to you to decide how to deal with them - fight together against evil, invite them into your party or simply ignore them.\r\n\r\nSouls with a Twist\r\nAshen is faithful to the \"souls\" genre of stamina-based combat, introducing players to a punishing yet satisfyingly vast world. But here’s the twist - no two gameplay experiences are alike. Whether you’re exploring bogs, investigating a fjord or pillaging an old palace, where you are at any given moment will dramatically alter the course of your adventure. It's a brutal open world; you're just living in it.\r\n\r\nCreatures + Combat\r\nAshen has no shortage of dangerous encounters, from hostile enemies to indigenous creatures. You'll be rewarded for studying the environment and its inhabitants, planning your adventure rather than flying by the seat of your pants. The flora and fauna within the world aren't just fantastical; they're often fatal. Each confrontation, no matter how trivial, has potentially dire consequences.\r\n\r\nCrafting is Key\r\nAs you discover survivors, you'll have the choice to invite them to your Town. But these aren't mere adventurers - they're potential collaborators, bringing a plethora of crafting skills, from blacksmithing to foraging expertise, in tow.\r\n\r\nStory + Score\r\nFamed fantasy author Mark Lawrence (The Broken Empire trilogy) and renowned band Foreign Fields collaborated closely with the development team at Aurora44 to craft a cohesive and unique narrative and sound."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"ashen","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39596.67644652336133489.b3703282-21c5-4da4-9f47-ba53b33b37b5.569189bd-72c6-4e18-bae2-96f3542515b3","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23937.67644652336133489.b3703282-21c5-4da4-9f47-ba53b33b37b5.6942594f-c17c-410a-9d71-00ecff3baa23","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9983.67644652336133489.b3703282-21c5-4da4-9f47-ba53b33b37b5.d4bcadbe-e7f1-41d6-a73a-a8205ce9aae2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16775.67644652336133489.b3703282-21c5-4da4-9f47-ba53b33b37b5.a45d66f4-fbd1-4539-a839-adc6ac675f6b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28021.67644652336133489.b3703282-21c5-4da4-9f47-ba53b33b37b5.bf225274-44ef-4919-aebd-5ba99ed82378","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.188.67644652336133489.b3703282-21c5-4da4-9f47-ba53b33b37b5.20226d28-47ca-4877-b53e-016b15c938a9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20468.67644652336133489.b3703282-21c5-4da4-9f47-ba53b33b37b5.dca77d85-e5ed-423b-b5a5-a5df49f2aa0d"],"ReleaseDate":5248483394427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":7480389632},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-one","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Racing & flying","Simulation","Sports"],"MetacriticUrls":{},"MetaScore":{},"ID":"9NZQPT0MWTD0","Title":{"en-us":"Asphalt Legends"},"Description":{"en-us":"Spark your competitive soul with Asphalt Legends and feel the collective heartbeat of the road!

Step into a maximum-security facility where every inmate has a past—and a plan. You'll have to fight to survive, investigate, and ultimately break free before the time runs out.\nUncover a scheme that threatens more than just your life—it could bring down the entire city. In this thrilling adventure, choices matter, and escape is your only salvation!\n\nPick Your Path, Break Free\nChoose between two protagonists — Thomas, a reporter caught in a web of lies, or Bob, an undercover agent sent deep into the prison system. Each storyline delivers over 20 hours of engrossing mystery, where your every choice matters. Navigate a prison ruled by three powerful gangs, interact with 48 uniquely crafted inmates, and uncover layers of intrigue through dozens of memorable NPCs.\nWith over 100 handcrafted quests, multiple escape routes—each with its own risks and rewards—several possible endings, and more than 500,000 words of gripping narrative, Back to the Dawn delivers a deeply replayable RPG unlike anything you've experienced.\n\nUncover the Truth\nThomas the Fox is a journalist caught up in a dark conspiracy and who got thrown into a maximum-security prison for not playing ball. Working with your attorney friend on the outside, you must collect evidence to save yourself and the city from grave danger!\n\nBob the Panther is an undercover agent who has never failed on any of his missions, but he is growing exhausted of this line of work and wants out. But a personal tragedy drags him back for one last job in prison. Experience a hardboiled tale of betrayal, vengeance, and truth! \n\nWhat Kind of Prisoner Will You Be?\nThis is an enormous prison with lots to do and many places to explore, but make sure you follow the rules, or at least try not to get caught! \nYou’ll encounter all kinds of challenges as you explore your new environment. But will you be a model prisoner and just try to keep your head down, or will you leave a trail of chaos and destruction in your wake? It’s all up to you.\n\nA Colorful Cast\nMeet a colorful cast of inmates in your prison, each with an interesting story to tell. You can either make them your friends or fight, bully and rob them into submission. Will you be part of a gang or a cunning lone wolf? Pick a side!\n\nOpen the Character Growth System\nAre you a tough guy who lets his fists do the talking, a thief who hides in the shadows, or perhaps a smooth talker who manipulates the scene?

Holly, you decide what room appears behind it and each decision shapes your path as you navigate through the manor.

Hunted from within. This is Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6.\n\nDeveloped by Treyarch and Raven, Black Ops 6 is a spy action thriller set in the early 90s, a period of transition and upheaval in global politics, characterized by the end of the Cold War and the rise of the United States as a single superpower. With a mind-bending narrative, and unbound by the rules of engagement, this is signature Black Ops.\n\nThe Black Ops 6 Campaign provides dynamic moment-to-moment gameplay that includes a variety of play spaces with blockbuster set pieces and action-packed moments, high-stakes heists, and cloak-and-dagger spy activity.\n\nIn a best-in-class Multiplayer experience, players will test their skills across 16 new maps, including 12 core 6v6 maps and 4 Strike maps that can be played 2v2 or 6v6.\n\nBlack Ops 6 also marks the epic return of Round-Based Zombies, the fan-favorite mode where players will take down hordes of the undead in two brand-new maps. With additional content still to come, players can look forward to even more exciting maps and groundbreaking experiences dropping into both Multiplayer and Zombies.\n\n\nActivision may modify or discontinue online service in the future, which may impact the continued availability of online gameplay. Online services may be discontinued due to factors including number of players.\n\nAdditional storage space may be required for mandatory game updates.\n\nFor more information, please visit www.callofduty.com.\n\n© 2024 Activision Publishing, Inc.

Thrust amongst the unfamiliar and colourful inhabitants of the Eye, you need to build friendships, earn your keep, and navigate the factions of this strange metropolis, if you hope to survive to see the next cycle.\r\n\r\nROLL THE DICE. DO THE WORK. GET PAID. SURVIVE.\r\nInspired by Tabletop Roleplaying games, Citizen Sleeper uses Dice, Clocks and Drives  to create a player-led experience, where you choose your path in a rich and responsive world. Each cycle you use the dice you are dealt to choose what to do with your time. Make or break alliances, uncover truths and escape your hunters. Survive and ultimately thrive, one cycle at a time, and sometimes against the clock!\r\n\r\nTURN UP FOR YOUR FRIENDS\r\nThe station plays host to characters from all walks of life, trying to eke out an existence among the stars. Salvagers, engineers, hackers, bartenders, street-food vendors, each has a history which brought them here. You choose which of them you wish to help, and together you will shape your future.\r\n\r\nACCESS THEIR SECRETS\r\nEventually, you will learn to use your dice to hack into the station’s cloud to access decades of digital data, uncover new areas and unlock secrets. This is your unique power, and with it you can change your future. Corporate secrets, rogue AIs and troves of lost data await those willing to dive into the depths of the station’s networks.\r\n\r\nYOU WERE MADE TO DIE\r\nEssen-Arp: to them you are just property, one more asset in a portfolio that stretches across the stars. You are the product of an abusive system, in a universe where humanity’s expansion is marked by exploitation and extraction. Escape the makers of your decaying body, and chart your own path in a richly imagined, deeply relevant sci-fi world which explores ideas of precarity, personhood and freedom."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"citizen-sleeper","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36304.14019812399166283.dc5d064e-3693-46fa-896f-9287938c5df4.9b2d3ae4-15fb-4d50-a9c3-19100ae3e0ae","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24625.14019812399166283.0c3f93ec-a911-40b1-8b4c-b132fc8edd39.b1d0f34c-5ed8-47ad-a884-1a43671a375e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25059.14019812399166283.0c3f93ec-a911-40b1-8b4c-b132fc8edd39.ffb6fc1e-0d28-484e-b21e-c76eefe2662a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17309.14019812399166283.0c3f93ec-a911-40b1-8b4c-b132fc8edd39.328fcd9e-702e-4d02-9241-8397ad563525","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12203.14019812399166283.5202d2e0-b9e5-4ab3-8b20-564378356c83.226d0de1-74c1-422e-86c3-9e6b076f01ab","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48132.14019812399166283.0c3f93ec-a911-40b1-8b4c-b132fc8edd39.b688fc8d-a5fe-4596-99a8-01a177b048f1","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63676.14019812399166283.0c3f93ec-a911-40b1-8b4c-b132fc8edd39.0590c76c-692c-460c-a6af-3e2eb8f09968","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56438.14019812399166283.0c3f93ec-a911-40b1-8b4c-b132fc8edd39.14ef461c-1f8b-471a-af90-50c9ec7d22c3","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63675.14019812399166283.5202d2e0-b9e5-4ab3-8b20-564378356c83.af0a53b6-476e-49ff-a6fb-b41612cb64f2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36704.14019812399166283.0c3f93ec-a911-40b1-8b4c-b132fc8edd39.ffd87940-7b28-46a4-97e1-abe91e00ad3a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59670.14019812399166283.5202d2e0-b9e5-4ab3-8b20-564378356c83.9f32473f-8d18-4df8-b4df-9c3d86af36ca"],"ReleaseDate":5249559614427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":1242415104},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-series-x","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Role playing","Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":86},"ID":"9MWCF1XBJBR2","Title":{"en":"Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector"},"Description":{"en":"The highly anticipated sequel to one of 2022’s most acclaimed RPGs!\n\nYou are a sleeper, an emulation of a human mind housed in an artificial body.

Commandeer a ship, build a network of crew and allies, and take on challenging contracts as you seek to build a future for yourself.\n\nChoose a class, configure your skills and assemble your crew in unique tabletop-inspired gameplay. Your future depends on the roll of a dice, as you make difficult choices in a complex world. Reinventing the award-winning systems of Citizen Sleeper, this dice-driven RPG will satisfy both fans of the original game and new players alike.\n\nSTAY AHEAD OF YOUR PAST\nAfter a desperate attempt to free yourself from servitude by rewriting the very code that governs your system, you are on the run again, this time with a malfunctioning body, a price on your head and no memory of your past.\n\nREBOOT / REBUILD / REPAIR\nCitizen Sleeper’s revolutionary dice system returns, revised for the sequel. Manage your stress or take damage to your dice. Deal with glitches as they accrue in your system.

See below for a personal note from the devs.  \r\n\r\nExperience and explore a surreal 1920s dreamscape a vaudevillian, film noir-inspired almost-reality.  In a world full of performance, intrigue and deception, you play as Dawn, the imaginary friend of a little girl, Didi.\r\n\r\nEvery kid’s imaginary friend is special, and you have powers that no one else does – you can walk up to a lit wall, and become your shadow.  You can shift in and out of your shadow, at any lit surface, to help Didi explore the mysteries surrounding her family. \r\n\r\nIn CONTRAST:    \t\r\n• Shift between the physical 3D world and the 2D shadow world (become your shadow!)\r\n• Experience a new story and world, exploring adult themes through a child’s eyes\r\n• Solve mind-bending puzzles\r\n• Manipulate light sources and real-world objects to create unique shadow landscapes\r\n• Immerse yourself in a lush world of cabaret singers, circus performers, and magic\r\n\r\nSome talk about CONTRAST:\r\n• IGN: Best Indie at E3 2013\r\n• “It’s as if Limbo and Bioshock Infinite had a baby while watching Pan’s Labyrinth” - Venturebeat\r\n• 10 nominations at the 2014 Canadian Videogame Awards, including Game of the Year\r\n\r\nCONTRAST is developed by Compulsion Games, an 8 person indie studio in Montreal, founded on making creative, passionate and high quality games.\r\n\r\nDev note: Hi everyone! Thanks for checking out CONTRAST.  We’re really excited about the Xbox One version.  It is the tightest version of the game we’ve made, and has had the advantage of the improvements that we’ve made since the initial launch of the game and the power of the Xbox One (believe it or not, dynamic shadows make for a pretty power hungry game).\r\n\r\nWe made this game because we wanted to make something different.  We wanted a simple, mature story – something that’s not “congratulations, here’s a fancy sword, go save the world!” – based around a mechanic that hadn’t been seen before.  If you like games that are different or unique, set in different time periods, with unusual stories or new mechanics, then this might be a good game for you.  If you like super-hard platformers, this isn’t that type of game.\r\n\r\nThe average play time is roughly 4-5 hours, but it’s like most games based around puzzles – some of you will complete it faster or take longer to explore the world.

Take control of a highly polished, realistic kitchen equipped with all kinds of utensils and stands. Unlock and master over 60 recipes or use dozens of lifelike ingredients to cook everything you like. A simulator spiced up with a dash of real-life physics!\r\n\r\nYour kitchen’s got all the gear a chef might need. Griddles, cookers, gas stands, ovens and tons of utensils like pots, pans, plates, knives, spatulas and blenders! On top of that there are over 120 ingredients available in the pantry: meat and fish, fruit and veggies, dairy products and various liquids. There’s also a full set of spices and herbs for adding that extra flavour!\r\n\r\nLifelike cooking experience! All the ingredients respond to your actions by changing temperature, appearance and taste. Every time you’re slicing potatoes, flipping steaks or boiling a soup, there are some real-life physics applied to it. Once you learn the cooking mechanics and start serving dishes, you’ll see yourself becoming a better chef with every new plate on the checkout.\r\n\r\nCareer mode is a culinary journey zero-to-hero style and your task is to gain fame for you and your restaurant. You’ll start from the basics and progressively unlock new more complex dishes and start serving more customers as your fame and experience grow. Once you master the recipes and workflow, you’ll be able to unlock various perks and skills.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you’re not interested in playing by the rules, you’re going to love the Sandbox mode. Access all the recipes and ingredients and prepare whatever you like without any pressure. You don’t even have to cook anything! Game physics gives you unlimited opportunities. Throw knives like darts, set up cutting boards like dominoes, set the whole kitchen on fire, blow up the oven and save the day using a fire extinguisher!\r\n\r\nLeaderboard Challenge. Ever wanted to prove that you are the best chef around? Well, now you can! Pick an order and take it to the kitchen. No distractions, just one simple goal – serve the best dish you can, as fast as you can.

Instilling joy and wonder, they provide a unique bond that enables you to utilize their skills for traversing the planet and solving environmental challenges. Once peaceful creatures, they now succumb to an unknown infection driving them to behave aggressively, which makes your mission to save them an urgent necessity.\n\nExploration-driven gameplay\nThe gameplay encourages curiosity-driven exploration of its distinct ecosystems—such as the colorful Nari jungle or mysterious Mâruba swamp—creating an interconnected world. With non-aggressive combat mechanics designed for healing rather than defeating and indigenous Flute melodies that you play to tame creatures, the game further highlights the creature-saver nature of the experience.\n\nMeaningful Narrative\nStep into the shoes of Vic, a 22-year-old nature adventurer as she navigates through the immersive expedition alongside Tabitha, a composed and astute researcher. Together, you confront the recurring infection—called “the withering” by the local race of Naam—threatening Ava’s inhabitants. The game's narrative, co-created by Rhianna Pratchett, is a journey of wonder and mystery but also discovery, leading to the revelation of the planet's captivating secrets.\n\nSaving Through Understanding\nCreatures of Ava is a game featuring a dense, populated world of rich ecosystems filled with creatures that play a vital role in the planet’s natural balance. It goes beyond traditional creature-related genres, offering a deeper understanding and connection with the things you’ll encounter on Ava. Once you come to understand the true meaning of the infection, you will be challenged to step out of the human-centric point of view and learn about the real toll it takes to preserve the primal beauty at the very roots of Ava.\n\nAfter all, can you save something you don't understand?\n"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"creatures-of-ava","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61939.14400608729854013.f3e97c2f-202d-48ee-b6f7-8667ef1177d0.468789fb-05d8-4f5f-a03c-e465f259932c","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61352.14400608729854013.def91861-1e56-4559-843c-07d1bf87a320.975ccfb0-33d0-495a-a2f9-80cc1aa96097","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61282.14400608729854013.def91861-1e56-4559-843c-07d1bf87a320.13a16845-3f20-48af-b53f-8c15da28b154","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29403.14400608729854013.6d870f3d-31e1-4c98-ba22-b1a07adac47d.0e93d8b2-3777-4dc5-a272-0c51804f83ad","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55526.14400608729854013.6d870f3d-31e1-4c98-ba22-b1a07adac47d.549bceae-c393-43d5-86df-8b91e52278fb","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48844.14400608729854013.6d870f3d-31e1-4c98-ba22-b1a07adac47d.8c4df159-ee2b-41d3-bf85-dd3a14d6cb33","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26800.14400608729854013.def91861-1e56-4559-843c-07d1bf87a320.ee0e5d01-2bc7-4ffd-936b-4d1b25dfa86f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20311.14400608729854013.6d870f3d-31e1-4c98-ba22-b1a07adac47d.0dab8a75-c18d-4815-a270-122b06837b2b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50683.14400608729854013.6d870f3d-31e1-4c98-ba22-b1a07adac47d.6836b76a-914e-48af-9b52-ea8edaa25840","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15602.14400608729854013.6d870f3d-31e1-4c98-ba22-b1a07adac47d.bc8353d6-9eac-4348-b859-95d72e16450b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25160.14400608729854013.6d870f3d-31e1-4c98-ba22-b1a07adac47d.f3f74cc0-a92f-4481-a191-6d7454cae739"],"ReleaseDate":5250272378427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":8482406400},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-series-x","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Sports"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PS5":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/cricket-24/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5"},"MetaScore":{"PS5":57},"ID":"9PPN49GPNH5M","Title":{"en":"Cricket 24"},"Description":{"en":"Cricket 24 is the culmination of a decade of Cricket video game development and includes teams from every corner of the globe.

This will require some dirty work and shady clientele, but you have no other choice, right? When the big boss calls once again, bring a bucket and a mop cause you will really need them. Are you up for the challenge?\n\nYou need nerves of steel to clean crime scenes left behind by major and minor criminals. You may not have money for your daughter’s hospital stays, but what you do have is a very particular set of skills. With the help of an entire arsenal of equipment, you will clean blood, pack up bodies, and remove any odor. All this under the pressure of a ticking clock and police breathing down your neck.\n\nKey Features:\n\nDeep Clean - Grab your trusty mop and sponge. They will be handy for the majority of the missions. When the mess becomes too much, whip out the powerwasher and clean the outside spaces deeply. Or when the smell is a bit too strong, you have more than just an odor eliminator.\n\nArm’s Race - Sometimes, the equipment you have is not enough and needs an extra oomph. If your lamps or flashlights are not strong enough, get new ones! If there is too much blood outside, get a different set of power washer nozzles! So, before every mission, check the perks available and boost your cleaning arsenal. If you can make your job easier... why not take that opportunity?\n\nDeep Pockets - Make money in any way you can! Mobsters are known for being generous, but sometimes that’s not enough. And certain objects may be too tempting. Who is going to miss this expensive watch?

The stress from denying your truest self could bring a new host of troubles!\nChoose appropriate guardians for your heirs, or train them yourself. But what do you do if the legal heir is not quite up to the job?\nViolent characters may develop a fearsome reputation, cowering your timid subjects into obedience with the dread you inspire.\n\n\nWARFARE\n\nRecruit men-at-arms units and powerful knights to supplement your royal levies.\nResearch new technologies to increase the wealth and military might of your realm.\nHire mercenaries and Holy Orders for your major wars.\nSupplement your income with ransomed prisoners or raiding parties on neighboring realms.\n\n\n\nINTRIGUE\n\nUse your spymaster to discover plots against your dynasty and your rule.\nRecruit agents to assist your schemes to undermine or murder anyone who stands between you and power.\nSeduce other characters for love or political power.\nGather information for blackmailing purposes or call in favors whenever your plans need an extra bit of influence.\n\nParadox Account required for certain features of the game.

In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop.\r\n\r\nIF AT FIRST YOU DON’T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN \r\nEvery new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you’ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you’ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted.\r\n\r\nSINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER \r\nAre you the hero or the villain? You’ll experience DEATHLOOP’s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you’ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you’re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna’s stylish sneakers and invade another player’s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign.\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF – PARADISE OR PRISON    \r\nArkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.

It is on one such expedition that Seign Kesling, a young and gifted imperial officer, and Nowa, a boy from a remote village, meet each other and become friends.\r\n\r\nHowever, a twist of fate will soon drag them into the fires of war, and force them both to reexamine everything they believe to be right and true.\r\n\r\nEiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes became the #1 funded Kickstarter video game of 2020 thanks to phenomenal support from the community. 505 Games is truly honored to publish Eiyuden Chronicle and work with Rabbit & Bear to help deliver a memorable gaming experience to fans. The goal of Rabbit & Bear and 505 Games is to make sure Eiyuden Chronicle reaches its true potential and delivers a worthwhile JRPG the community will enjoy."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36865.13543256525081284.f15b7882-c55a-47fc-85b9-b14dab29de6d.c7080d3f-fad9-45bd-89c6-50faf1dda4e1","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19475.13543256525081284.f15b7882-c55a-47fc-85b9-b14dab29de6d.0dcc6383-f682-4ddd-98f0-939383e57442","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17711.13543256525081284.f15b7882-c55a-47fc-85b9-b14dab29de6d.a6d08d13-b8c6-4d85-a2bc-ab9eab993471","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48598.13543256525081284.f15b7882-c55a-47fc-85b9-b14dab29de6d.aaa3bfc7-01a6-4b73-b82b-0cf8afeb3daf","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53578.13543256525081284.f15b7882-c55a-47fc-85b9-b14dab29de6d.69113b10-a3a1-4ef8-91cc-85c762dbe119","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49474.13543256525081284.f15b7882-c55a-47fc-85b9-b14dab29de6d.fa5562d0-b9fd-4c53-a1b1-de4ea63abb78","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18020.13543256525081284.f15b7882-c55a-47fc-85b9-b14dab29de6d.2957c8d3-1782-41f1-bc72-86adab83ea9a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50714.13543256525081284.f15b7882-c55a-47fc-85b9-b14dab29de6d.741da074-03a4-47d6-9116-8016013be271","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25620.13543256525081284.f15b7882-c55a-47fc-85b9-b14dab29de6d.c24fe013-27fb-4e57-9da7-c20989237e94","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46897.13543256525081284.f15b7882-c55a-47fc-85b9-b14dab29de6d.93536d59-1661-4dfd-88e1-e5f84b818b3e"],"ReleaseDate":5250180794427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":21918584832},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-series-x","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Shooter"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/enter-the-gungeon/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-one"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":85},"ID":"9NB65S6LFZRT","Title":{"en-us":"Enter The Gungeon"},"Description":{"en-us":"Enter the Gungeon is a gunfight dungeon crawler following a band of misfits seeking to shoot, loot, dodge roll and table-flip their way to personal absolution by reaching the legendary Gungeon’s ultimate treasure: the gun that can kill the past.\r\n"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"enter-the-gungeon","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13557.13523638002129104.cc876367-b7e1-4567-bb7d-ed2e240c0376.06accfbe-2a57-4ecc-b2e4-15061b6eb1cf","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25168.13523638002129104.c6409dd2-6943-4aff-904b-3c174b8190d5.072bfb33-f483-43b7-b9d2-0c1b6370869c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17575.13523638002129104.073d0772-02af-454c-908c-e3fa10917304.7e9dcf79-7fe5-41a7-ac02-2898a6824703","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29362.13523638002129104.acd5a8b6-ce85-4bd9-ace4-fec5aed702fb.be50220b-53cc-4123-bba3-098f7b679c14","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64039.13523638002129104.9641001c-2150-4b17-8740-d3c2ba0fe149.32b56c63-5ed3-4cd7-ac01-62160a3a1b14","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57382.13523638002129104.192c0abb-9f65-4dc7-aedb-48c0bb02b240.7faa6394-55e8-4dcf-9514-97d8178677ab","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56139.13523638002129104.ec5961df-3dfa-42b2-a6b0-6c032fb1a4c9.0d2a9ff7-6559-4fe0-9f43-686c7de804b4","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49371.13523638002129104.9c1aa308-a5a0-4b06-9db9-351e3f55c410.61e4475d-a107-4faa-a56e-70ce4aafc3c1","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31478.13523638002129104.1c2db620-3dec-4749-b244-c9f7ccd61a64.67867cd0-7b57-4b7c-b294-9bc0e539756b"],"ReleaseDate":5247955634427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":1079812},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-one","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxSeriesX":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/eternal-strands/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-series-x"},"MetaScore":{"XboxSeriesX":76},"ID":"9NNKJNRKFT0G","Title":{"en":"Eternal Strands"},"Description":{"en":"Eternal Strands is the debut fantasy action-adventure title from Yellow Brick Games, a new independent studio founded by industry veterans. \r\n\r\nTHE WORLD IS YOUR WEAPON\r\nAt the heart of Eternal Strands beats a revolutionary new system for gameplay interactions: heat spreads, cold chills, and real-time destruction allows for unprecedented reactivity in combat. Hurl burning tree trunks at enemies with telekinetic, snap nearby trees to block opposing fire, or channel raw telekinetic force to rip boulders from the ground. \r\n\r\nWEAVER OF MAGIC\r\nWear the Mantle, a magical cloak that channels raw magic into raging flame, chilling ice, and telekinetic force. Combine your growing array of powers with enchanted weapons and armor crafted from slain enemies to create a custom look and style. Block incoming attacks with a wall of magical ice, lash out waves of flame from a massive two-handed blade, or toss enemies off a cliff with raw force. \r\n\r\nSTAND AGAINST GIANTS\r\nFace gigantic adversaries and defeat them through a mix of sword, spell, and mobility. Leap onto and climb their massive forms to attack from different angles. Shatter armor or slice at weak spots to diminish their protection. Use ice to pin limbs of a towering foe, arcane flames to burn their fur, or catch lobbed projectiles and turn their attacks back upon them in battles that will leave scars upon the land. \r\n\r\nUNSTABLE CLIMATE TO MASTER\r\nEnhance the effectiveness of your ice abilities during a flash freeze to open up new paths. Use a heatwave to start a wildfire and watch it spread towards enemies as it consumes the tinder-dry trees and grass around it. \r\n\r\nA WORLD RICH WITH SECRETS\r\nExplore the wilds, the capital city of Dynevron, and the secrets beneath as every surface is climbable. Magical abilities can create bridges, burn barriers, or launch Brynn across the world. The next-generation physics system encourages and rewards player creativity in exploration as much as combat. As the Enclave’s secrets unfold, return to base camp to consult with a rich cast of characters. Each are keen to discover the mysteries of what happened to this lost bastion of power and knowledge. \r\n\r\nA realm of mystery, opportunity, danger, and wonder: the Enclave awaits. \r\n "},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"eternal-strands","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55883.13736859116442717.a1ffa0ea-8877-44c8-8310-2433a1850d55.289fef47-87b7-442a-baab-439a9636d846","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57348.13736859116442717.5a75a042-ff9f-46c1-a965-4e98c3acb3aa.6c8e2b05-bf09-4852-9830-02442456569a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24755.13736859116442717.5a75a042-ff9f-46c1-a965-4e98c3acb3aa.3dd0c355-746d-41bd-91d8-514bf35a5a6f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37192.13736859116442717.5a75a042-ff9f-46c1-a965-4e98c3acb3aa.f15c2064-5f4b-4a6d-9c2e-a5ab7a432533","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58093.13736859116442717.5a75a042-ff9f-46c1-a965-4e98c3acb3aa.18f7e342-0839-4982-a864-9be8c3be64d3","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47115.13736859116442717.5a75a042-ff9f-46c1-a965-4e98c3acb3aa.84aa1f3e-ab29-4ab2-90aa-0f6761a357dd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19082.13736859116442717.5a75a042-ff9f-46c1-a965-4e98c3acb3aa.1c6580e7-1400-4667-8b82-2714e898f195","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63191.13736859116442717.5a75a042-ff9f-46c1-a965-4e98c3acb3aa.bbe9e176-6a36-4202-8e72-ffffb7040d20","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26689.13736859116442717.5a75a042-ff9f-46c1-a965-4e98c3acb3aa.dcf917e3-b3bf-4c62-8000-44db5af40e16","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10944.13736859116442717.5a75a042-ff9f-46c1-a965-4e98c3acb3aa.8faefd61-0016-4590-9b72-5263ef57b571","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26010.13736859116442717.5a75a042-ff9f-46c1-a965-4e98c3acb3aa.6d0cb1ca-f523-4f5a-b9d7-5e62cfce31b1"],"ReleaseDate":5250422786427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":20954812416},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-series-x","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Simulation"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxSeriesX":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/expeditions-a-mudrunner-game/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-series-x"},"MetaScore":{"XboxSeriesX":80},"ID":"9NP9J3T0JWRL","Title":{"en":"Expeditions: A MudRunner Game"},"Description":{"en":"Embark on ever-rewarding scientific expeditions as you adapt to nature's challenges and unravel the mysteries of uncharted lands alone or with other players.

reign.\n\nFrom the creators of For The King, the much-loved RPG that blends roguelite and tabletop gameplay comes a new chapter in Fahrul’s history, designed on an updated engine bringing innovation and gameplay refinement for returning heroes and new adventurers alike.\n\nINSPIRED BY TABLETOP ADVENTURES\nFor The King II is easy for anyone to pick up and play, but takes skill, patience, and strategic excellence to master whilst remaining infinitely replayable with a procedurally generated map that ensures no two playthroughs will ever be the same. Unique yet familiar dice roll inspired movement, encounter and combat mechanics add even more spontaneity and variety as your fortunes rise and fall on the roll of the dice.\n\nDIGESTIBLE ROGUELIKE CAMPAIGN\nFor The King II provides a complete campaign with over 30 hours of gameplay, split into 5 separate adventures, each narratively linked.

As a solo player you can control all characters in your party, giving you complete ownership of the campaign map and combat strategy whilst in four-player co-op you must coordinate and negotiate with your party members. Play online multiplayer with your friends controlling your own character(s) or play offline co-op on the same PC. Offline co-op supports multiple controllers; each controller will have input control on everyone’s turn.\n\nEVOLVED TURN-BASED COMBAT\nInspired by turn-based classics, For The King II adds strategic depth to much-loved combat mechanics with the new Battle Grid, where movement and position provide you and your enemies with strategic buffs and penalties. Defend the back row by equipping a mighty Tower Shield, push enemies into lethal pools of burning fire, or entangle melee troops with dark magic cast with weapons looted from vanquished foes. The choice is yours!\n\nEXPLORE A FANTASTICALLY REALIZED REALM\nFahrul is both beautiful and deadly in equal measure. On your journey you will encounter a wealth of diverse biome environments brought to life in a breathtaking art style.

As the leader of possibly the last civilized society on Earth, you’re going to build the city your survivors live in, discover new technologies, explore frozen wastelands and most importantly, manage and rule society to prepare it for life in an unforgiving world. Whether you’re an enlightened ruler or an iron-fisted tyrant, you’ll discover choices in this world aren’t as easy as they seem, and that holding power over people has a cost as heavy as the responsibility you feel in caring for them.\r\n\r\nSHAPE YOUR SOCIETY\r\nEstablish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. \r\n\r\nShould you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless.\r\n\r\nEXPAND AND EXPLORE\r\nSurvival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable.

You no longer have to fantasize about being a goat, your dreams have finally come true! \r\n\r\nGameplay-wise, Goat Simulator is all about causing as much destruction as you possibly can as a goat. It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. Destroy things with style, such as doing a backflip while headbutting a bucket through a window, and you'll earn even more points!

Your favorite chaotic sandbox is back and more beautiful than ever, with updated graphics, every DLC, and more bugs that you can shake a goat at. WASD to rewrite history.\n\nYour goal? Chaos! Your muse? Pilgor the goat! If you’ve had your horns in the sand for the last 10 years, Goat Simulator is a game about causing as much destruction as you possibly can, as a goat. Headbutt, backflip and ragdoll your way around each level to earn points, and come up with creative ways to ruin an NPC's day.\n\nGoat Simulator Remastered is the remaster no one asked for. It comes with everything you loved about the original game and more, with new and improved visuals, updated textures, shiny new lighting, and some brand-new foliage showing off the finest in advanced goat simulation technology. We've also completely reworked Mutators, allowing you to pick and choose whichever \"\"goat\"\" you desire from a handy in-game menu. You just have to catch them all first!\n\nThe remaster also includes every DLC from the PC version, and one of our favorites from the mobile version, including:\n- Goat City Bay\n- Goat MMO\n- Goat Z\n- PAYDAY\n- Waste Of Space\n- (Mobile) Buck to School\n\nThere are also less exciting new things, like general optimization and bug fixing - but we promise we mainly fixed the boring ones. \n\nKey Features:\nYou can be a goat… again\nNo really, that’s still the main selling point\nA brand spanking new mutator menu that lets you mix and match goats to your heart's content - if your contentment means abominations\nAs buggy as you remember -  just because it's a remaster doesn’t mean we haven’t left in an unhealthy dose of physics-based bugs because why not?\nAll DLCs included - we could have sold them separately to you again, but if we’re honest this is already a cash-grab\nNew and improved graphics, lighting, VFX and animations - as well as revamped foliage for the prettiest leaves you’ll see in a Goat Sim game excluding Goat Simulator 3\n\nDisclaimer:\nGoat Simulator Remastered is a completely stupid game and has been a completely stupid game since we first invented goat simulation over 10 years ago.

Hell Let Loose drops you into the action, where you will have to fight across fields, bridges, forests, towns and more war-torn environments! Lumbering tanks will be dominating the battlefield and crucial supply chains fuelling the frontlines, you are essential to the colossal, combined arms warfare. \r\n\r\nTake to the battlefield in this squad-based, 50v50 multiplayer game, and choose one of our 14 roles available within the Command, Infantry, Recon and Armour unit types. Play as an Officer, Spotter, Medic, Tank Commander and more, to experience every aspect of World War II combat. Each role is equipped with different historical weapons, vehicles, and equipment that are intricately detailed, bringing the realism to the brutal and bloody warfare. Unit focussed gameplay is crucial and when done well can command the tide of battle. \r\n\r\nThe combat takes place across huge, to-scale maps, recreated by utilising aerial and satellite imagery of real battle locations  in stunning detail using Unreal Engine 4. These realistic battlefields are divided up into large capture sectors allowing emergent and constantly unique gameplay to evolve between the two forces of fifty players. Work as a team and make continual large scale, tactical decisions as to where to attack or defend.\r\n\r\nManage resources and supplies to call in support, bombing runs, new vehicles, strafing runs and to reinforce strong-points or flank enemies. When a sector is captured, it will generate one of three resources for your team, creating a complex game that will influence your team’s march to victory. Strategy is key to success.\r\n\r\nHell Let Loose is not about kill to death ratios – teamwork is central to gameplay. Communication is essential. Players work together beneath the leadership of Officers and their Commander to take strategic targets on the battlefield and dominate the opposition. In Hell let loose, it’s always better to tackle things as a team. If you think you can handle the chaos of war, we’ll see you on the frontlines!"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"hell-let-loose","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63026.13994037977696381.11786523-fa42-45f3-be9b-efb6e563d28d.0a6fe171-a209-4c1c-ae3b-b04d736768dc","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25745.13994037977696381.69b46634-b674-4f7e-bc72-20b5f309407d.fc1da2a1-26d8-4789-b67d-52eb2f4ef9bf","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33370.13994037977696381.69b46634-b674-4f7e-bc72-20b5f309407d.4c93c920-f1d4-43e1-9ca5-8630cbc33f25","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50086.13994037977696381.69b46634-b674-4f7e-bc72-20b5f309407d.b8d4a1ab-db55-416e-9541-3ae58b4866b8","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28978.13994037977696381.69b46634-b674-4f7e-bc72-20b5f309407d.b09c9332-14a3-47af-a37c-80d41510e734","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50251.13994037977696381.69b46634-b674-4f7e-bc72-20b5f309407d.6013f160-72ec-4d0e-a007-247f7acc99b9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6878.13994037977696381.69b46634-b674-4f7e-bc72-20b5f309407d.77203aa4-501f-44b7-a3a4-e43b9ed8d6c6","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50086.13994037977696381.69b46634-b674-4f7e-bc72-20b5f309407d.b8d4a1ab-db55-416e-9541-3ae58b4866b8","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25745.13994037977696381.69b46634-b674-4f7e-bc72-20b5f309407d.fc1da2a1-26d8-4789-b67d-52eb2f4ef9bf","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47176.13994037977696381.7375b314-a874-494d-ab5e-9721b7cd0ef4.bd11c8ae-2afe-41d4-97bc-b6408e33c5b0"],"ReleaseDate":5249375906427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":32892899328},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-series-x","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-one"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":88},"ID":"C4Z7QM8FSXM2","Title":{"en-us":"Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice"},"Description":{"en-us":"From the makers of Heavenly Sword, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, and DmC: Devil May Cry, comes a warrior’s brutal journey into myth and madness.\r\n\r\nSet in the Viking age, a broken Celtic warrior embarks on a haunting vision quest into Viking Hell to fight for the soul of her dead lover. \r\n\r\nCreated in collaboration with neuroscientists and people who experience psychosis, Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice will pull you deep into Senua’s mind."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"hellblade-senuas-sacrifice","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28362.67453348098260763.a9f96429-c651-425e-97d2-e8861561f15f.f7b26f7f-73d8-4f53-9f3b-4d9e4e4d23f0","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36408.67453348098260763.a9f96429-c651-425e-97d2-e8861561f15f.6fa0e006-6905-4ec6-8e54-86cb8360ff63","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34451.67453348098260763.a9f96429-c651-425e-97d2-e8861561f15f.bb37f910-87c0-4d25-aa2c-c62ff3603243","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62656.67453348098260763.a9f96429-c651-425e-97d2-e8861561f15f.be026cb6-4d45-4156-b55e-b039d7e11a2b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12499.67453348098260763.a9f96429-c651-425e-97d2-e8861561f15f.2dbf4de5-d415-4cac-a7d6-0c04569d206f"],"ReleaseDate":5248276034427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":16506433536},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-one","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Role playing","Shooter"],"MetacriticUrls":{},"MetaScore":{},"ID":"9NC7NRD0CM11","Title":{"en":"Heretic + Hexen"},"Description":{"en":"Forged by Raven Software on a modified DOOM engine, Heretic and Hexen were released in 1994 and 1995, pushing first person shooters into bold new territory.

Race competing Hunters to track down bosses, send them to hell, claim their bounty, and fight your way to extract. If others only slow you down, go alone. If you find strength in numbers, take up to two teammates along.\n\nProgression and Permadeath: Risk everything to unlock dark powers and forbidden wealth. Every bullet counts. Every wound hurts. And every death is permanent. But if you succeed, every victory will be unforgettable.\n\nAtmosphere and Sound Design: Hear footsteps squelch in the mud as you wait with bated breath to strike. The world speaks. Every gunshot is a message; every howling dog a klaxon. Gramophones murmur with the haunting melodies of Port Sulphur Band. Listen, and you might live to die another day.\n\nConstantly Evolving Game: Keep striving for more, the world is always growing. Frequent updates challenge you with new Events, expand your arsenal of weapons, introduce new characters, and offer the chance to get ornate rewards.

For years, the colorful cast of The Friendly Neighborhood delighted audiences across the globe with their cooky capers and educational adventures. However, as time went on and interest waned, the production studio found themselves out of money and closed their doors for good. Toy sales would dwindle, and birthday balloons and cakes would find new mascots. In time, the once household names would fade into increasingly niche fandoms. Until one night years later, the studio unexpectedly clicks back to life and starts broadcasting The Friendly Neighborhood. TV sets across the globe flicker for a moment before the familiar puppets return for a surprise encore! But this isn't your typical family-friendly holiday special... are those puppets eating each other!?\n\nThinking the antenna on top of the main building has started broadcasting old episodes, the city sends Handyman Gordon to straighten things out. It doesn't take Gordon long to find that the typically friendly neighborhood has become a lot less welcoming. Stepping into his work boots, you'll have to fend off ferocious friends, solve a plethora of playtime puzzles turned perilous, and hopefully uncover the dastardly truth at the heart of this terrifying tale.\n\nIf you're tired of games that rely on gore more than solid scares, then come on over to the streets of MFN! Featuring a mix of action and adventure, MFN is the perfect game for horror fans looking for something a bit different. Sure, there might not be any dismemberment or decapitations.

In this corrupt gambler’s paradise, the stakes are high and The House always wins. Play a varied and challenging world of events as Tyler; the Racer, Mac; the Showman and Jess; the Wheelman. Each driver must take on races, missions and challenges to earn the respect of the Valley’s underground and compete in the ultimate race to finally take down The House. \r\n\r\nYour car is at the centre of everything you do. Craft unique rides with deeper performance and visual customization than ever before. Push them to the limit when you narrowly escape the heat in epic cop battles. Go head-to-head with other racers on or off-road through canyons, deserts, mountains, and the city. Raise the stakes by putting down additional in-game currency on all events, challenges and missions that can multiply your winnings. But you could lose it all. Finally, for ultimate bragging rights, connect and compete via Autolog recommendations with your friends and, for the first time, with potential rivals. Your leaderboard will populate with other players of similar skill level so you can see how you rank around the world.\r\n\r\nFrom insane heist missions to devastating car battles to jaw dropping set piece moments, Need for Speed™ Payback delivers an edge of your seat, adrenaline-fueled action-driving fantasy.\r\n \r\nKEY FEATURES\r\n• Scrap to Stock to Supercar: Your car is at the centre of everything you do in Need for Speed Payback.

Collect, win, or buy the hottest after-market parts and craft multiple cars into the perfect driving machines.\r\n\r\n• Live out an action-driving fantasy: Play through an explosive, action-packed adventure as three distinct playable characters united by one common goal: revenge. Tyler, Mac and Jess team up to even the score against all odds, and enter the ultimate race to take down The House.

And they aren't limited to just the \"Chapter Challenge\" story missions - the 3 characters can also be used in \"NINJA TRIALS\". Also, \"NINJA GAIDEN\" series heroine Ayane has a dedicated story.\r\n\r\n■Thrilling battles where you must be constantly alert\r\n\"Tests of Valor\", a special phase for series fans who want to enjoy battles even further, have been included. In each chapter, there are hidden Crystal Skulls that serve as gates to \"Test of Valor\" areas. By stepping foot onto these areas, battles will occur where players must face the fiercest and strongest enemies from the \"NINJA GAIDEN\" series.\r\n\r\n■Upgrading characters adds more replay value!\r\nBy collecting hidden \"Golden Scarabs\", using \"Karma\" collected in battles, and more, players can unlock new weapons and ninpo to upgrade their characters. Of course, upgrades you have applied can be carried over for 2nd and successive playthroughs. Among moves that can be unlocked, there are moves that are new to the series, such as \"Cicada Surge\", which allows you to dodge any enemy attack, \"Meditation\", which allows you to consume your Ki gauge to recover health, and more.\r\n\r\nNote: This product is included in \"NINJA GAIDEN: Master Collection\", and \"NINJA GAIDEN: Master Collection Deluxe Edition\".

Fly smoothly from deep space to planetary surfaces, with no loading screens, and no limits. In this infinite procedurally generated universe, you'll discover places and creatures that no other players have seen before - and perhaps never will again.\n\nEmbark on an epic voyage\nAt the centre of the galaxy lies a irresistible pulse which draws you on a journey towards it to learn the true nature of the cosmos. But, facing hostile creatures and fierce pirates, you'll know that death comes at a cost, and survival will be down to the choices you make over how you upgrade your ship, your weapon and suit.\n\nFind your own destiny\nYour voyage through No Man's Sky is up to you. Will you be a fighter, preying on the weak and taking their riches, or taking out pirates for their bounties? Power is yours if you upgrade your ship for speed and weaponry.\nOr a trader? Find rich resources on forgotten worlds and exploit them for the highest prices. Invest in more cargo space and you'll reap huge rewards.\nOr perhaps an explorer? Go beyond the known frontier and discover places and things that no one has ever seen before. Upgrade your engines to jump ever farther, and strengthen your suit for survival in toxic environments that would kill the unwary.\n\nShare your journey\nThe galaxy is a living, breathing place.

It may or may not change over time or release as a final product. Purchase only if you are comfortable with the current state of the unfinished game.\n\nYou play as a Monarch in possession of an ancient soul-stealing crown with magical abilities. With its power, establish a kingdom in a perilous wilderness and defend it from mutants and bandits roaming the land. \n\nBuild, gather resources, farm the land and more to turn your fledgling realm into a commanding, self-sustaining kingdom. As your fame grows, more will flock to your banner – but so will those who have come to overthrow you, including your friends in up to six-player co-op.\n\nBUILD ANYWHERE\nConstruct a kingdom from scratch and transform the wilderness into a developed community. Decide which buildings go where, and then manage your citizens to automate everything from there! Don’t like where you placed something? Just pick it up and toss it somewhere else!\n\nLIFT ANYTHING\nThrow whole trees at the sawmill to make planks or run through the forest carrying your sawmill to absorb trees along the way! Resource gathering is fun and easy thanks to your crown’s power. Or maybe you have too many enemies around. Pick up monster nests and place them near bandit camps to have them fight each other instead (and obtain free loot!).\n\nFIGHT LIKE AN ANIME PROTAGONIST\nVillagers being eaten by mutants? Run across a lake at 100 km/h to rescue them in time! Being shot at by outlaws up in the hills? Spin-attack so fast that you take off like a helicopter and descend on them from the skies!\n\nSURVIVE THE SEASONS\nManage resources and stockpile enough food to last the winter. Guard your farmlands (and peasants) from hungry mutants while waiting for your crops to grow. Keep polluting workshops away or see the land turn barren. Ultimately, keep your people happy or see them desert you for the outlaws.\n\nPLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS\nOverthrown can be played offline in singleplayer, or with a group of up to six friends in online co-op! However – only one can wear the crown.\n\nFull details on the latest status of the game, how you can give feedback and report issues can be found at www.playoverthrown.com."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"overthrown-game-preview","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41364.13814604299939965.87e684aa-f67c-4783-95a7-a850ec9be36a.ff6f72c7-1fac-465a-b5b5-6a43d8c14f67","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":false,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26123.13814604299939965.524c1214-56a9-498f-afe3-d8c621aad72a.b79e3828-aa36-4716-9b45-f503e0d8733f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5125.13814604299939965.524c1214-56a9-498f-afe3-d8c621aad72a.ae5d996d-0983-4a18-83d8-9fadfaf6c1f1","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54569.13814604299939965.524c1214-56a9-498f-afe3-d8c621aad72a.f97eb212-d3c7-4b28-82f3-05b5165a53ec","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31407.13814604299939965.524c1214-56a9-498f-afe3-d8c621aad72a.ebad569f-ca71-41dd-84dd-dc9be1c6da8b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52998.13814604299939965.524c1214-56a9-498f-afe3-d8c621aad72a.7f6a210e-2506-4b54-8663-550c8105eb34","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1618.13814604299939965.524c1214-56a9-498f-afe3-d8c621aad72a.6a827a28-8544-43d0-9dcb-7ffb7684a5dc","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33762.13814604299939965.524c1214-56a9-498f-afe3-d8c621aad72a.ae92a2de-53e7-4950-8d2c-caf0f649669d"],"ReleaseDate":5250376166427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":16002281472},"MetacriticPlatform":null,"AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Shooter"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxSeriesX":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/overwatch-2/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-series-x"},"MetaScore":{"XboxSeriesX":78},"ID":"C1C4DZJPBC2V","Title":{"en":"Overwatch® 2"},"Description":{"en":"Overwatch® 2 is an always-on and ever-evolving free-to-play, team-based action game set in an optimistic future, where every match is the ultimate 5v5 battlefield brawl featuring new heroes and maps, different ways to play, and unique cosmetics!

It is subject to change before its release as a finished product. Please purchase only if you are comfortable with the game in its current state.\n\nQ. What kind of game is this?\nA. In this game, you can peacefully live alongside mysterious creatures known as Pals or risk your life to drive off a ruthless poaching syndicate.\nPals can be used to fight and breed, or they can be made to work on farms or factories.\nYou can even sell them or eat them.\n\n▼Survival\nIn a harsh environment where food is scarce and vicious poachers roam, danger waits around every corner. To survive, you must tread carefully and make difficult choices...even if that means eating your own Pals when the time comes.\n\n▼Mounts & Exploration\nPals can be mounted to traverse the land, sea and sky—allowing you to traverse all kinds of environment as you explore the world.\n\n▼Building Structures\nWant to build a pyramid? Put an army of Pals on the job. There are no labor laws for Pals, so exploit them to your heart's content.\n\n▼Production\nFind a variety of useful Pals to make fire, generate electricity, or mine ore so that you can live a life of comfort.\n\n▼Farming\nSome Pals are good at planting seeds, while others are skilled at watering or harvesting crops. Work together with your Pals to create an idyllic farmstead.\n\n▼Factories & Automation\nLetting Pals do the work is the key to automation. Build a factory, place a Pal in it, and they'll keep working as long as they're fed—until they're dead, that is.\n\n▼Dungeon Exploration\nWith Pals on your side you can tackle even the most dangerous areas. When the time comes, you might have to sacrifice one to save your skin. They'll protect your life—even if it costs their own.\n\n▼Breeding & Genetics\nBreed a Pal and it will inherit the characteristics of its parents. Combine rare pals to create the strongest Pal of them all!\n\n▼Poaching & Crime\nEndangered Pals live in wildlife sanctuaries. Sneak in and capture rare Pals to get rich quick! It's not a crime if you don't get caught, after all.\n\n▼Multiplayer\nMultiplayer is supported, so invite a friend and go on an adventure together! And of course you can battle your friends and trade Pals, too.\nIn online co-op play mode, up to 4 players can play together.\nMeanwhile, a dedicated server can allow up to 32 players to play together.\n\nCollect all kinds of exciting Pals to fight, farm, build, and work for you in this completely new multiplayer, open world survival and crafting game!"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"palworld","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64359.13654268679289325.5cd9109c-5095-44b3-a4a2-0bbf822058b7.d23fd29a-8afc-45bf-8ae4-20983e5ea746","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":false,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42368.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.8d70e6c3-3f80-4433-9720-1cbabc621ec6","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61138.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.fd7eb204-dc7f-4107-a237-c191d63a47cd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55732.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.88b644de-dd0d-486c-a3a7-dfd26c3e3b2e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39973.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.2e7d429e-6749-4a77-a51c-c367e73a9175","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5789.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.6c3c163b-0362-457f-b0f6-f62ff9388750","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52925.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.b2e45903-d5d1-4911-983e-efff17ee7277","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30971.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.ca18135b-9f35-40ab-9999-89960a8cb441","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10748.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.6acfb2bc-dfdb-4106-a0ba-82a6489fc51c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14003.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.394a498c-f60b-46e2-9ef0-05af8ea3dc52","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21475.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.34450769-d837-414b-bb16-f1ce8365bf86","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32586.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.d4e1b4d3-e291-4ecf-ad8e-8826a6c4f7f5","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50425.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.7e860136-9e36-441d-9ddb-2740d979e350","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.552.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.947bdcff-d499-408f-bac8-588d12934011","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19747.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.dcf183b3-48fc-4e8a-b584-ee46cb648452","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19681.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.754865e1-b9aa-4df3-b36d-a5458a3184d3","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31947.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.c4515cfc-aa8d-4bb8-b589-1ba8d115edd1","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52814.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.1cecdbba-5931-4c3a-999c-dbc65d1df1a0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.540.13654268679289325.6a83727c-1a87-4c27-abef-2ebbcbacef16.f0ae85ea-c4ba-4eea-b74e-5fb236c562ad"],"ReleaseDate":5250098498427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":26545160192},"MetacriticPlatform":null,"AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Family & kids","Platformer"],"MetacriticUrls":{},"MetaScore":{},"ID":"9N3TF03KNTBD","Title":{"en":"PAW Patrol Mighty Pups Save Adventure Bay"},"Description":{"en":"A fallen meteor has given the pups mighty powers – and left Adventure Bay in a mighty mess.

Featuring turn-based tactical combat on procedurally generated maps, and resource management on a global scale, Phoenix Point offers endless replayability and a brutal challenge.\r\n\r\nFollowing a global environmental disaster, the Pandoravirus appeared and began reshaping creatures, including humans, into hideous mutants. Unable to stop the progress of the virus, much of human civilization was wiped out -- only small enclaves remain, separated by their principles and the vast landscape. The Phoenix Project, an ancient failsafe against global catastrophe is the only hope to unite mankind and take back the planet.\r\n\r\nLead the Phoenix Project from its base at Phoenix Point. Research and develop new technologies and techniques, plan operations, build alliances to unite the planet-- or simply destroy your rivals. It's up to you to save the planet and rebuild civilization, but there may be much more to the alien threat than meets the eye.\r\n\r\n* Mutating Alien Menace: Face down an ever-changing alien threat that adapts to your tactics and offers no respite even as your team becomes more powerful and technologically advanced.\r\n\r\n* Uncover the Secrets of the Pandoravirus: Phoenix Point features a complex narrative, with multiple endings that the player can only uncover via multiple playthroughs. Discover a secret history, as you learn about the origins of the mutants, the Pandoravirus, and Phoenix Point itself through exploration, diplomacy, and research.\r\n\r\n* Manage Diplomatic Relations: The Phoenix Project is not the only organization trying to reclaim the Earth. The militaristic New Jericho, the mystical Disciples of Anu, and the technophiles of Synedrion all offer unique rewards for co-operation and threats for opposition. It is up to you to decide how, or even if, to deal with them.\r\n\r\n* Take Aim on the Battlefield: In addition to equipping and commanding units, Phoenix Point lets you take direct control of your soldier's shots in combat, with a unique free-aiming system. Target enemy weakspots, weapons, or valuables, or just go for center mass.\r\n\r\n* Next-Gen Tech with Classic Pedigree: Phoenix Point was designed by Julian Gollop, the creator of the X-COM series in the 1990s. Keeping the core ethos of X-COM while updating the visuals, technology, and systems to modern standards has made Phoenix Point best-in-class."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"phoenix-point","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23750.14507726714197033.ea391b48-d8cb-4724-a6cb-765168bd5161.0029c50b-c234-475e-9928-0185fc83e0aa","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27297.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.8f0d79d4-fb71-4169-bb64-0b77cac69f7f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3522.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.17680a69-6b0d-4293-a53c-6d16fe0035fd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39128.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.c1af4919-7997-458a-ae19-4b9cf83ecfaa","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63541.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.c3d3f2f0-5855-4872-bbdd-720b19605e27","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34869.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.dd0e9d28-4298-463e-98c1-032a9fa45f9c"],"ReleaseDate":5248809122427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":25358311424},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Role playing","Strategy"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":88},"ID":"9PJD2KMX7TZ6","Title":{"en":"Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire - Ultimate Edition"},"Description":{"en":"The award-winning RPG from the masters at Obsidian Entertainment finally arrives on Xbox One, featuring all major updates and expansions. \r\n\r\nThe god Eothas awakens from his slumber, killing you and stealing a piece of your soul.

Join the ranks of this fictitious American city's police force and experience the everyday life of a police officer. Begin with parking violations and work your way up to shouldering greater responsibilities.

Always be tough, but fair: respect the law and gain more experience to unlock more neighborhoods, districts, and duties!\r\n\r\nPOLICE SIMULATOR: PATROL OFFICERS includes a dynamic traffic system that organically creates traffic flows and car accidents, as well as emergency situations that randomly pop up during your shifts. Be ready to respond at a moment’s notice! Enter the open world of Brighton, where you can choose which neighborhoods you patrol and keep safe. Patrol three unique districts, each home to several neighborhoods. Each one has a distinct flair: from the high rises of downtown to the historical buildings of Brickston. The Intuition System allows you to pick up on important clues when interrogating witnesses and can help you resolve situations immediately – so make sure you're always paying attention to everything being said and done. Your duties are your responsibility!\r\n\r\nProgressing and unlocking new districts also adds new duties. Begin by issuing tickets, but be ready to handle accidents that can happen right in front of your eyes! Many different duties are waiting to be encountered in this living and breathing city. Stop drug deals from taking place in the local park, chase graffiti sprayers illegally tagging walls, stop speeding cars with your police siren, and even set up road barriers and cones around traffic accidents.

Continuing Arkane’s legacy of carefully crafted worlds and immersive sims, Redfall brings the studio’s signature gameplay to this story-driven action shooter.\r\n  \r\nFEATURES:\r\n\r\nUncover the Truth, Take Back Redfall\r\nThe island town of Redfall, Massachusetts, is under siege by a legion of vampires who have blocked out the sun and cut the citizens off from the outside world. Explore the open world and immerse yourself in a deep story campaign as you unravel the mystery behind the vampires’ appearance. Ally with a handful of survivors against the creatures threatening to bleed the town dry.\r\n \r\nSlay Alone or Squad Up\r\nRedfall blends single- and multiplayer options seamlessly, allowing the player to venture into the darkness alone or to squad-up for up to four player co-op. Teammates can try different hero loadouts and combine their strengths to find creative solutions to the vampire apocalypse. You will collect an arsenal of specialized weaponry and customize your character with unique upgrades and abilities to suit your playstyle for guns blazing, stealth combat, and everything in-between.\r\n \r\nUnconventional Heroes Vs. The Night\r\nCreated by science experiments gone wrong and gifted with psychic abilities, Redfall’s vampires will challenge you and your squad to get creative. You will choose from a team of diverse heroes – each with their own character-specific abilities – to overcome the vampire legion and their brood of maniacal followers. \r\n- DEVINDER CROUSLEY – The Verified Cryptid Hunter: A cryptozoologist and aspiring inventor. Armed with weapons of his own creation, he’s on a mission to prove himself.\r\n- LAYLA ELLISON – The Telekinetic Threat: A biomedical engineering student who volunteered for a medical trial where something went very wrong, leaving her with intense telekinetic abilities.\r\n- REMI DE LA ROSA – The Ingenious Ingeniera: A brilliant combat engineer who has spent her life on the frontlines. With the help of her robot cohort, Bribón, she’s determined to help rescue Redfall’s survivors.\r\n- JACOB BOYER – The Deadeye with an Undead Eye: An ex-military sharpshooter turned private contractor. Strange happenings on Redfall have left Jacob with a mysterious vampiric eye and a spectral raven that’s never far from his side.\r\n\r\nThe Open World of Redfall\r\nRedfall is a true Arkane experience set in a rich world that blends the familiar with the extraordinary.  Redfall’s open world is handcrafted by the master level designers behind Prey’s Talos I space station and Dishonored’s Dunwall. From the town’s once-bustling downtown and the haunted forest to the decimated seaside boardwalk and beyond, you will fight through cultist outposts and supernatural psychic spaces as you piece together Redfall’s many mysteries."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"redfall","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60545.14091188428798620.2f105d2c-1b7f-4fd0-b12e-5483087f47d1.0dd8d438-0fc9-4d71-ac1b-21ed62e26ec2","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59879.14091188428798620.2f105d2c-1b7f-4fd0-b12e-5483087f47d1.f5ee4981-d0af-4cab-a54b-1efe4a6a9c7b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26451.14091188428798620.2f105d2c-1b7f-4fd0-b12e-5483087f47d1.b5ef54df-fd9a-4a8c-b8b0-d369d81c1cb3","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7297.14091188428798620.2f105d2c-1b7f-4fd0-b12e-5483087f47d1.cfcd6112-0fd3-452b-8f51-f07de14766ee","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8675.14091188428798620.2f105d2c-1b7f-4fd0-b12e-5483087f47d1.2b2b2f75-3c4c-407d-99a3-25af0b1a7ddd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51509.14091188428798620.2f105d2c-1b7f-4fd0-b12e-5483087f47d1.6cd2cd6f-43d2-4856-978e-3b460841b490","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18324.14091188428798620.2f105d2c-1b7f-4fd0-b12e-5483087f47d1.a690aecb-3b7f-4f9a-ab7e-994db308109b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8788.14091188428798620.2f105d2c-1b7f-4fd0-b12e-5483087f47d1.bde8360b-feb7-49fa-9df6-f05a7d15d95f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54692.14091188428798620.2f105d2c-1b7f-4fd0-b12e-5483087f47d1.a00a9c81-b13f-49dd-8e1e-090433714c63"],"ReleaseDate":5249871842427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":101325934592},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-series-x","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Sports","Action & adventure","Multi-player Online Battle Arena"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxSeriesX":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/rematch/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-series-x"},"MetaScore":{"XboxSeriesX":75},"ID":"9N5K7HWXL4Q6","Title":{"en":"REMATCH"},"Description":{"en":"A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON FOOTBALL\nThird Person Action - Tackle, dribble, aim, and shoot; dive into the heart of the action from an immersive viewpoint.\nOne Player Control - Observe the action, position yourself, execute perfectly: every decision matters, and relying on your teammates is essential to prevail.\nSkill-based Gameplay - In a level playing field, with no player stats, victory is only about player skill and tactical coordination. \n\nINTENSE ACTION & DEEP TACTICS\nCredible Football, with an arcade twist - Feel like an amazing athlete, easily performing all the iconic moves of football. \nNon-stop Action - No fouls, no offsides, no pauses... no time to rest. \nAccessible mechanics with a lot of depth - Just like real football, winning requires both accuracy, fast reactions  as well as flawless team collaboration.\n \nAN ONLINE TEAM-BASED EXPERIENCE\nTeam-based online gameplay - Designed from the ground up as an online multiplayer experience, Rematch offers split-second gameplay response that always feels fair.\nCompetitive Modes - Challenge yourself and your mates to reach the top leagues.\nSeasonal content - There's always something new around the corner.

His true love, Elaine Marley, has turned her focus away from governing and Guybrush himself is adrift and unfulfilled, having never found the Secret of Monkey Island. Hip, young pirate leaders led by Captain Madison have shuffled the old guard from power, Melee Island has taken a turn for the worse, and famed businessman Stan has been imprisoned for ‘marketing-related crimes’.\r\n\r\nBanter with old friends and new faces on familiar islands now under dangerous new leadership. Then, take to the high seas and explore the new and unknown as you work your way out of tough predicaments. Clever puzzles, bizarre situations, and devastating ripostes are all that stand between Guybrush and glory.\"\r\n\r\nReturn to Point & Click Swashbuckling\r\nBringing classic point-and-click gameplay to the modern-day, intrepid pirates will solve puzzles and explore the islands with a clever evolution of classic adventure game controls. Context-sensitive interactions, reactive dialog trees, and an easy-to-use inventory system make pirating a breeze.\r\n\r\nEmbark on Archipelago Adventures\r\nNavigate the sometimes-friendly confines of Melee Island, a familiar place that finds itself under new management by leaders who have put the squeeze on old friends and new faces. Venture out into uncharted lands like the aptly named Terror Island and the chilling outposts of Brrr Muda to make allies and enemies alike.\r\n\r\nCreated by a Legendary Crew\r\nThe new chapter in the Monkey Island series marks the return of the iconic series’ creator Ron Gilbert, joined by game co-writer Dave Grossman, art director Rex Crowle (Knights & Bikes, Tearaway) and composers Peter McConnell, Michael Land, and Clint Bajakian (Monkey Island, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge)."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"return-to-monkey-island","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32947.14176324986442763.11fa95be-f98f-4be1-a416-9571cd1286df.80a3abd4-c71c-4e0a-88a9-1c8542fbd318","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62602.14176324986442763.a35026f0-f7f8-4b8f-8be0-13b4f65221ec.06002ae9-6fc7-4b42-a7ac-bfbcdb38c563","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24519.14176324986442763.a35026f0-f7f8-4b8f-8be0-13b4f65221ec.8d35c788-f2d4-4755-bf08-cb4d21ea2bbf","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40965.14176324986442763.a35026f0-f7f8-4b8f-8be0-13b4f65221ec.77f2967d-9f1f-43a6-8141-7e0f4a5b593c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46451.14176324986442763.a35026f0-f7f8-4b8f-8be0-13b4f65221ec.03cc23b3-54aa-41ce-acee-415b947eeb0b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52652.14176324986442763.a35026f0-f7f8-4b8f-8be0-13b4f65221ec.f1eb267b-9dfa-4861-bba8-df81be0bf125","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62801.14176324986442763.a35026f0-f7f8-4b8f-8be0-13b4f65221ec.b7e22e65-107f-4a44-ac63-543af4a1c947","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58114.14176324986442763.a35026f0-f7f8-4b8f-8be0-13b4f65221ec.1546a1a7-4703-4de0-a8e0-998ed53a00c8","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51479.14176324986442763.a35026f0-f7f8-4b8f-8be0-13b4f65221ec.88c14ee4-e9df-4d85-ad48-5a33d08fd43d"],"ReleaseDate":5249721254427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":4938948608},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-series-x","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Platformer"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxSeriesX":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/revenge-of-the-savage-planet/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-series-x"},"MetaScore":{"XboxSeriesX":79},"ID":"9PFTV8DKNCHX","Title":{"en":"Revenge of the Savage Planet"},"Description":{"en":"WELCOME TO THE PIONEER PROGRAM!\nIn a future knocked off its axis by corporate greed and stupidity, you have been made redundant and abandoned on the far edge of space with little gear and no safety net.

Scavenge for gear and resources, hunt for wonders, make hard decisions to survive and pave the path through the Chornobyl Anomalous Zone.\n\nTHE ZONE\nThousands of adventurers from all over the world find a new life here, in a mysterious and dangerous place on the land of the Chornobyl Anomalous Exclusion Zone. Become one of them, and start your own through an immense, atmospheric open world, full of dangers and mysteries. Shed light on the dark secrets of the second disaster, hunt mutants, and explore the hazardous anomalies in search of precious artifacts.\nWill your skill and courage be enough to overcome anomalous and human threats, or will you become one of many who lost to the Zone?\n\nTHE STORY\nThe Zone keeps hundreds of secrets and thousands of stories, revealing them only to the bravest and most dexterous. Starting as a lone stalker, explore a unique post-apocalyptic world and decide who will get a bullet and who is worthy of your helping hand. And while making decisions, be sure: many choices and actions will have their own, sometimes far from the obvious, consequences.\nTo be a savior and a faithful friend, the figure for stalker's campfire legends. Or to carry out harsh, but profitable missions for those who are in control of the Zone — you are free to be anyone here, even yourself.\n\nTHE DANGER\nBandits, mercenaries, official authority forces, lone stalkers, various factions, and mutants… The world of «S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl» is full of predators who strive to seize your loot or get a taste of human flesh. Analyzing their behavior and picking specific tactics for each species is the only way to win or at least get out of the fight alive.\nThere is no absolute safety because your foremost enemy is the Zone itself, capable of challenging all your skill and courage at the most unexpected moment.\n\nTHE ACTION\nThe Zone has become a perfect black market for weaponry from all around the world. This means that in the potential arsenal of stalkers, there are more than 30 models of various firearms and the ingenuity of gunsmiths who are ready to modify them for greater lethality and reliability. Define your distinctive combat style, select the most efficient weapon, and customize it to your taste for maximal tactical advantage.\nA wise stalker said: the most dangerous weapon is not the gun in your holster but the gumption, tenacity, and sharp reflexes. Keep that in mind on your path to the Heart of Chornobyl!\n\n\nCertain features of the game, including mods, may not be accessible to Xbox child accounts.

Magic has returned to the world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Technology merges with flesh and consciousness. Elves, trolls, orks and dwarves walk among us, while ruthless corporations bleed the world dry. You are a shadowrunner - a mercenary living on the fringes of society, in the shadows of massive corporate arcologies, surviving day-by-day on skill and instinct alone. When the powerful or the desperate need a job done, you get it done... by any means necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the urban sprawl of the Seattle metroplex, the search for a mysterious killer sets you on a trail that leads from the darkest slums to the city’s most powerful megacorps. You will need to tread carefully, enlist the aid of other runners, and master powerful forces of technology and magic in order to emerge from the shadows of Seattle unscathed.\r\n\r\nThe unique cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation over 30 years ago. Return to the world of Shadowrun, with this cult-classic turn-based tactical RPG finally ported to consoles.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\nGripping Tactical Combat: When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With the variety of weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices. A successful run requires commanding a team of runners with the right balance of combat, tech, and magical abilities.\r\n\r\nSkill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun Returns’ classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose. Want to start summoning spirits as an ork Shaman and evolve into a cybered-up weapon specialist? Do it!\r\n\r\nEngaging 2D/3D Art Style: Shadowrun Returns mixes dynamic 3D characters and lighting with a vibrant, hand-painted environment. Illustrated character portraits bring every conversation to life. Explore a world filled with detail, from the slums of the Redmond Barrens to the extravagant offices of powerful corporations.\r\n\r\nUpdated/Redesigned UI: To better experience this cult-classic on consoles, the UI has been redesigned to meet the needs of console players!

The Director's Cut adds a host of new content and enhancements to the original game making it the definitive version on consoles of this one-of-a-kind cyberpunk RPG experience.\r\n\r\nMan Meets Magic & Machine\r\nIn 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall.\r\n\r\nIt’s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge’s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the “Flux State” controls the city of Berlin. It’s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there’s no better place to earn a quick payday.\r\n\r\nNow, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return…\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\nA Classic, Story-Driven cRPG adapted to consoles: Dragonfall hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG’s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development. Immerse yourself in a smart, 20+ hour campaign with a diverse cast of all-too-human characters.\r\n\r\nA One-of-a-Kind Cyberpunk Setting: Experience the unique “Tech meets Magic” dystopian future of Shadowrun, a fan-favorite game setting. Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut is the perfect entry point to the setting for those with no prior Shadowrun experience, while providing plenty of classic Shadowrun characters and tech for veteran players to sink their teeth into.\r\n\r\nCommand Your Team: Lead a small team of shadowrunners - each with their own outlook, motivations, and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses.

The Extended Edition adds 6+ hr Shadows of Hong Kong Bonus Campaign, audio commentary to the game, and a long list of improvements since the game’s initial launch - including new visual effects and updated dialogue. Experience the most impressive Shadowrun RPG yet, hailed as one of the best RPGs and strategy games of 2015, and now available on consoles!\r\n\r\nHONG KONG. A stable and prosperous port of call in a sea of chaos, warfare, and political turmoil. The Hong Kong Free Enterprise Zone is a land of contradictions - it is one of the most successful centers of business in the Sixth World, and home to one of the world’s most dangerous sprawl sites. A land of bright lights, gleaming towers, and restless spirits where life is cheap and everything is for sale.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\nShadows of Hong Kong Bonus Campaign: Set in the weeks following the events of the main campaign, the Shadows of Hong Kong bonus campaign will give you -- and your team -- the opportunity to turn the tables on the elite corporate police force that once hunted you. Through layers of corporate greed and urban strife, you will contend with dangerous enemies, uncover a deadly conspiracy, and cement your reputation as a Prime Runner… assuming that you survive, of course.\r\n\r\nA Classic, Story-Driven cRPG adapted to consoles: Shadowrun: Hong Kong hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG’s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development. Immerse yourself in a smart, 15+ hour campaign with a diverse cast of all-too-human characters.\r\n\r\nA One-of-a-Kind Cyberpunk Setting: Experience the unique “Tech meets Magic” dystopian future of Shadowrun, a fan-favorite game setting. Shadowrun: Hong Kong is a perfect entry point to the setting for those with no prior Shadowrun experience, while providing plenty of classic Shadowrun characters and tech for veteran players to sink their teeth into.\r\n\r\nCommand Your Team: Just like Dragonfall, Shadowrun: Hong Kong features a crew of flawed, dangerous runners with backstories that could only be possible in the tech-meets-magic Shadowrun setting. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. Each team member also has challenges to face in their own lives, which you can choose to brush aside or play an important part in.\r\n\r\nGripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat: When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters.

Fight against the Nazi war machine with an ally to share weapons, items and tactical know-how, as well as help each other get back in the fight when you go down during firefights.\n\nVISCERAL X-RAY KILL CAM AND ADVANCED GUNPLAY PHYSICS \nThe trademark X-ray kill cam returns, showing the true destructive power of every one of your signature shots. Bones deflect bullets to unpredictably rip new paths through enemy bodies and SMGs and pistols also trigger kill cams, showing multiple bullet shots in dramatic slow motion.\nTo land that shot you will need to think like a true sniper. Factor in rifle stock and barrel options along with gravity, wind and heart rate while you zero your sights on the target.\n\nAUTHENTIC WORLD WAR II WEAPONS AND CUSTOMISATION \nThe arsenal at your disposal will feature returning franchise favourites as well as a host of new authentic WWII weapons. Picking your loadout will be key to striking down the Reich’s nefarious plans! \nCustomise your weapon to suit your operating style. Find workbenches scattered around the campaign to customise and upgrade your rifles, secondaries and pistols with new scopes, stocks, barrels, magazines and more.

Who the heck are you?! Can you see me? You CAN, can't you? You've drunk the Spirittea and now you can see me!! Look, we've got problems! This town is crawling with troublemaking spirits. They've become lost because humans have stopped worshipping, leaving offerings or even thinking about them anymore.\r\n\r\nThis is- well... used to be a nice town, but there have been some strange goings-on lately! You're going to find the spirits causing mayhem and fix their problems so they can become paying customers, and get to know the townspeople and explore the mountain to its fullest!\r\n\r\nHere's the stuff you'll want to get involved in:\r\n\r\n-Solving the spirit's problems - To remember themselves, they'll need anything from some spicy noodles to finding and digging up their lost treasures, so get your problem-solving hat on!\r\n-Making friends with the locals - The townspeople all have their own schedules, likes, dislikes and hobbies to take part in - from bug catching to karaoke, there's something for everyone!\r\n-Managing the bathhouse - You'll need to clean towels, chop wood to heat the baths and seat the spirits with their friends for the ultimate bathing experience.\r\n-Upgrading and decorating - The local shops can make a whole lot of cool furniture and help you fix up overgrown areas of the bathhouse. We should make it big and fancy enough to take on all the spirits!\r\n\r\nTHE BATHHOUSE\r\n\r\nThe bathhouse is an ancient spirit building hidden up in the mountain, and it's up to you to clean it up and fill it full of customers! Once the spirits are in the bathhouse, you'll need to clean towels, chop wood to heat the baths and seat the spirits with their friends for the ultimate bathing experience. Each spirit has their own preferences so you'll need to get to know them all and upgrade the bathhouse to become the best bathhouse keeper around.\r\n\r\nTo keep your bathhouse running, you'll need to:\r\n-Keep the bathhouse and towels clean - Grab your trusty broom to sweep away the cobwebs and collect up all your towels, you'll need to keep everything clean, dry and organised.\r\n-Deliver a five-star service with food and scrubbing - Get ready to pamper your spirits with food straight from your kitchen and a give them a good scrub while they're relaxing! \r\n-Make the water perfect for each spirit - Chop wood for the boilers to heat up the water to the perfect temperature and mix up various elixirs to make the water perfect for each spirit - they'll all have their preferences and favourite recipes!\r\n-Sit friends together and enemies apart - Every spirit has others they like best, as well as some they don't enjoy spending time with at all! You'll have to plan carefully when you lead spirits to their baths - don't seat just anyone together! Unless, of course, you don't care about making money.  Which I do.  Very much so in-fact."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"spirittea","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60550.14327532839373067.e3a24cb8-3eb5-47ad-8d1b-19797522f44c.7f370a1c-e01f-4c2e-9c1a-38f0f333bd52","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3053.14327532839373067.e3a24cb8-3eb5-47ad-8d1b-19797522f44c.036d2911-fe17-4aba-822e-64aba46268e3","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37013.14327532839373067.e3a24cb8-3eb5-47ad-8d1b-19797522f44c.034b4bf6-c19c-4cd9-8b44-715cc08c95dc","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28380.14327532839373067.e3a24cb8-3eb5-47ad-8d1b-19797522f44c.f3bfe34b-56e6-4a24-9718-b511bef1d192","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16574.14327532839373067.e3a24cb8-3eb5-47ad-8d1b-19797522f44c.511e64d7-921b-4723-ab46-81404dbfb78b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36876.14327532839373067.e3a24cb8-3eb5-47ad-8d1b-19797522f44c.0b87662b-f492-4eef-b26a-531ff7d3640f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41709.14327532839373067.e3a24cb8-3eb5-47ad-8d1b-19797522f44c.01580892-e785-462d-b6f1-5fdab53ccc46","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60848.14327532839373067.e3a24cb8-3eb5-47ad-8d1b-19797522f44c.ec316c84-f3f0-44d2-bb6d-5d896d0d51f2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15384.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.39caf6af-2ae3-4fc6-b705-40eaa2ccacb4","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10292.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.9a8d0528-bd30-46a1-9b58-73cbcab980ae","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25878.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.86c3187c-9611-45c7-a60d-b0129df9042d","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17950.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.3f9c0fcc-1be3-429a-ad72-8b034452b97a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37380.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.43b5e386-d0ea-4524-a399-05f6ef8bc1bb","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57507.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.7ec79986-d6e9-4f71-a461-e7cec6882880","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54983.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.5aa55e81-628f-49c2-8b4a-d0c323847544","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15853.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.33cc295b-4f78-4ad2-890c-d4c50bd21c96","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8011.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.fcbcad15-7cee-4101-974e-e80cd1c79d1c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64599.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.add8d349-8f27-4761-80ae-15c630dc71cf","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6518.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.b434e9e0-84bc-41c6-b94e-6a8643f45cb0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44976.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.d7b8393d-e0f6-41c0-8d76-6047e015d5df","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55571.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.c21d450c-8a23-4f28-acc6-569e597540bd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8843.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.c2b2b5e6-0309-49fe-8b72-5bd3ed072ab9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56939.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.4d3ced40-f2d2-4608-83a8-b7f818db8f00"],"ReleaseDate":5250040898427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":492609536},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Shooter"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/splitgate-2/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":68},"ID":"9PF5Q1B0FHSL","Title":{"en":"Splitgate 2"},"Description":{"en":"Splitgate 2 is the only free-to-play shooter with portals, delivering next-level gunplay, fluid movement, and a constantly evolving experience, featuring a new Battle Royale where you can portal between unique worlds.

Support.xbox.com\r\n\r\nA galaxy-spanning adventure awaits in STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order, a new 3rd person action-adventure title from Respawn Entertainment. This narratively-driven single player game puts you in the role of a Jedi Padawan who narrowly escaped the purge of Order 66 following the events of Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith. On a quest to rebuild the Jedi Order, you must pick up the pieces of your shattered past to complete your training, develop new powerful Force abilities, and master the art of the iconic lightsaber - all while staying one step ahead of the Empire and its deadly Inquisitors. \r\n\r\nWhile mastering your abilities, players will engage in cinematically-charged lightsaber and Force combat designed to deliver the kind of intense STAR WARS lightsaber battles as seen in the films. Players will need to approach enemies strategically, sizing up strengths and weaknesses while cleverly utilizing your Jedi training to overcome your opponents and solve the mysteries that lay in your path. \r\n\r\nSTAR WARS fans will recognize iconic locations, weapons, gear, and enemies while also meeting a roster of fresh characters, locations, creatures, droids and adversaries new to STAR WARS. As part of this authentic STAR WARS story, fans will delve into a galaxy recently seized by the Empire. As a Jedi hero-turned-fugitive, players will need to fight for survival while exploring the mysteries of a long-extinct civilization all in an effort to rebuild the remnants of the Jedi Order as the Empire seeks to erase the Jedi completely.\r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES\r\n\r\n● Cinematic, Immersive Combat – Jedi: Fallen Order delivers the fantasy of becoming a Jedi through its innovative lightsaber combat system – striking, parrying, dodging - partnered with a suite of powerful Force abilities you’ll need to leverage to overcome obstacles that stand in your way. This combat system is intuitive to pick up, but takes training and practice to fully master its nuances as you gain new powers and abilities along your adventure.\r\n\r\n● A New Jedi Story Begins - As a former Padawan on the run from the Empire, you must complete your training before Imperial Inquisitors discover your plan to revive the Jedi Order. Aided by a former Jedi Knight, a cantankerous pilot, and a fearless droid, you must escape the evil machinations of the Empire in a story-driven adventure. Explore and overcome a wide range of challenges focused on combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. \r\n\r\n● The Galaxy Awaits - Ancient forests, windswept rock faces, and haunted jungles are all unique biomes you’ll explore in Jedi: Fallen Order, with the freedom to decide when and where you go next. As you unlock new powers and abilities, opportunities open up to re-traverse maps in new ways; leveraging the Force to augment the way you explore. Move quickly, however, as the Empire is actively hunting your every step in their effort to exterminate all remnants of the Jedi Order.\r\n\r\nConditions & restrictions apply.

You play as Jan Dolski, the lone survivor of a crash-landed expedition on a hostile planet. To survive, you must form a new crew for your mobile base. Using a substance called Rapidium, you create alternative versions of Jan—THE ALTERS—each one shaped by a different crucial decision from the protagonist’s past.\n\nCreate Your Alters\nUse the quantum computer onboard your base to simulate alternate outcomes of your past choices and uncoverJan’s different life paths. Each Alter brought to life thanks to the remarkable properties of Rapidium comes with unique skills and emotional depths. These variantions offer both opportunities and challenges as you navigate personal struggles and manage the fragile dynamics of your crew.\n\nSurvival Mechanics\nTo operate the mobile base, you’ll need to explore the planet’s surface in search of precious resources, like metals and organics. Yet venturing outside the safe haven comes with the risk of exposing you and your Alters to various deadly anomalies as well as the ever-present radiation of the sun. That’s why you must pay attention to the in-game day and night cycle and plan your daily activities wisely!\n\nBranching Storylines\nNavigate a narrative rich with moral dilemmas and branching paths. Your choices will shape Jan’s relations with his Alters which then will impact their journey and lead you to multiple outcomes and endings.\n\nExpand your base\nGathered resources can be used in different ways – create necessary items or develop your base with additional modules like Research Lab or Social Room. Sometimes you will have to choose between creating items specially for your Alters and ones that could push the mission forward, like Anomaly Detectors or Radiation Filters. The burden of every decision lies solely on your shoulders as you will never be able to satisfy everyone’s needs.\n\nExploration\nThe planet features unique biomes and secrets waiting to be found, but deadly anomalies stand in your way. Levitating rocks and eerie distortions of reality attract attention immediately, while other singularities remain invisible to the naked eye and require special tools to uncover. In all cases, you must be extra careful - or face the risk of instant death, radiation-induced injuries, and even disintegration of time and space.

Saving Colorado isn't going to be easy, but Arizona is counting on you, so... don't screw it up."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"wasteland-3","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54134.69010346493633739.074410cb-38ab-4f48-b6fe-0ffa69c89fa9.5e0b834f-57d5-42d6-9b07-c8d7bf92038a","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44447.69010346493633739.074410cb-38ab-4f48-b6fe-0ffa69c89fa9.fa83f393-10ba-49cc-890c-809a516160b5","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55727.69010346493633739.074410cb-38ab-4f48-b6fe-0ffa69c89fa9.165fbe23-80d9-4718-8f2b-47f8688caf1e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33330.69010346493633739.074410cb-38ab-4f48-b6fe-0ffa69c89fa9.ca10c11c-0e57-4fce-a857-f55cba778d50","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1644.69010346493633739.074410cb-38ab-4f48-b6fe-0ffa69c89fa9.869f5b52-9ac9-451c-9055-fba19ca4a184","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40344.69010346493633739.074410cb-38ab-4f48-b6fe-0ffa69c89fa9.23d3a1dd-0dcc-4ea4-a35d-68e6f91a1b3e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57671.69010346493633739.074410cb-38ab-4f48-b6fe-0ffa69c89fa9.68e2d4b8-5c2c-4586-89e1-e54dd2f0ca12"],"ReleaseDate":5249027714427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":10616832},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-one","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Classics","Role playing","Strategy"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/wasteland-remastered/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":64},"ID":"9NGH1FK0RJGL","Title":{"en":"Wasteland Remastered"},"Description":{"en":"Originally released in 1988, Wasteland brought the post-apocalypse to video games and inspired a genre.

The katamari that he created floated in space, sparkling, and brought back the lost starry sky.\r\nAs the starry sky was restored, the King's fans gradually grew in number all over the world.
