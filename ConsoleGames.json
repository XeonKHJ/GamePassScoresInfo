You awake on a mysterious island, your senses overwhelmed by the blinding sunlight and brilliant colors bouncing off every surface around you, the azure waters of a verdant Island lapping at your bare feet. A deep roar echoes from the misty jungle, jolting you into action, and you stand up – not afraid, but intrigued. Are you ready to form a tribe, tame and breed hundreds of species of dinosaurs and other primeval creatures, explore, craft, build, and fight your way to the top of the food-chain? Your new world awaits… step through the looking-glass and join it!\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\nARK: Survival Ascended has completely recreated and redesigned the artwork and worlds of ARK to take advantage of the latest in videogame technology, Unreal Engine 5, using high-end graphics features such as fully dynamic Global Illumination (“Lumen”), so that light bounces realistically of off surfaces and provides realistic reflections, and advanced mesh streaming (“Nanite”) of hundreds of millions of triangles for extreme detail.\r\n\r\nAdvanced new physics systems such as dynamic water so that every creature creates waves, ripples, splashes, and bubbles as they move through fluids, and fully interactive physical foliage where every blade of grass, bush, and tree reacts to characters, explosions, projectiles, and physics objects. Knock down a tree, and see it crash into other trees and disturb all the foliage on its way down to smacking into the grass below! Detect an enemy moving sneakily through the grass as it shifts and sways in response to their presence. Demolish a building and watch the pieces break apart realistically, interacting with the grass and water as they fall.\r\n\r\nARK: Survival Ascended includes access to all of ARK’s worlds, including Scorched Earth, Aberration, Extinction, ARK Genesis Part 1, ARK Genesis Part 2, and more. The Island and Scorched Earth are released now, with the subsequent expansion worlds to be added at no additional cost on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nThe definitive survival experience returns better than ever: design your Survivor, form a tribe, and tame, train, breed & ride dinosaurs within a living ecosystem.

Astroneer is set during the 25th century Intergalactic Age of Discovery, where Astroneers explore the frontiers of outer space, risking their lives in harsh environments to unearth rare discoveries and unlock the mysteries of the universe.\r\n\r\nOn this adventure, players can work together to build custom bases above or below ground, create vehicles to explore a vast solar system, and use terrain to create anything they can imagine. A player’s creativity and ingenuity are the key to seeking out and thriving while on exciting planetary adventures! In Astroneer you can:\r\n\r\n•Reshape the ground under your feet as though it were made of clay.\r\n•Survive on and explore carefully crafted planets that can be entirely deformed and traversed.\r\n•Snap together components and objects to build bases and vehicles.\r\n•Play with friends in 4 player online drop-in/drop-out co-op.\r\n•Discover and uncover the mysteries of the solar system\r\n\r\n•••Deform & shape everything around you•••\r\nIn Astroneer, players use their deform tool to dig, collect, shape and build anything they wish. Use this ability to dig to the center of the planet, build a ramp into the sky, or make megaliths just by using terrain! \r\n\r\n•••Explore an entire solar system•••\r\nOur vast solar system includes 7 wondrous planets that players can travel between and explore every inch of, from the entire spherical surface, through treacherous layers of caves, all the way down to mysterious the core. Each of those planets has unique and challenging surface and cave biomes that offer a multitude of challenges for players on their journey.\r\n\r\n•••Customize & build on the fly••• \r\nItems that Astroneers craft and find in the world can be snapped and connected together to create unique creations for any situation. Customize and decorate your bases, vehicles, and Astroneer.\r\n\r\n•••4 Player co-op•••\r\nAstroneer is better with friends. Group up with other players and work together to create massive industrial bases or to create fun games in the extensive creative sandbox. \r\n\r\n•••Survive & harness the power of the planets•••\r\nOnce Astroneers are ready, they may choose to attempt to understand and possibly harness the power behind mysterious structures found in the world.\r\n\r\nAstroneer began as a Game Preview title and would not be here today if not for your support, feedback, and ideas throughout that process. Now that we have hit 1.0 we will keep our pledge to continue building on the foundation that is Astroneer with free, ongoing content updates.

Forever.\r\n\r\nNEW BROS\r\nHarness the calculating intelligence and acid-spitting allure of Seth Brondle, wield Xebro’s flying Chakram, serenade (and grenade) terrorism with the flamenco firebrand Desperabro, or become the thing monsters have nightmares about, a stake throwing, unholy purging, self-resurrecting teenage Slayer!\r\n\r\nIf sniping is more your style, famed bug hunter Bro Gummer brings pinpoint liberation with his trusty rifle, while Demolition Bro’s Freeze Grenades put evildoers right back where they belong… ON ICE.\r\n\r\nNEW BADDIES\r\nA Bro only becomes a force when confronted with those who seek to destroy their freedoms, and in Broforce Forever, the terrorists are even more determined to delete democracy. Motorbike Maniacs will try to run you down, while machine gun placements, barbed wire, sandbags and bazooka-laden blimps conspire to make each visit to occupied territory a very, very bad day at the broffice.\r\n\r\nNEW CHALLENGES\r\nBros in search of even bigger battles can flex their muscles in new challenge levels known as Muscle Temples. Each campaign tasks Indiana Brones with navigating a perilous temple that features a new Threat Level and specific enemy types and hazards. Succeed and unlock one of four new flexes that can be deployed by any Bro, any time, any place. Just like freedom.\r\n\r\n***"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"broforce","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6563.14468359839778606.b9e6f982-23f2-4c58-a436-66ba564129a1.8d25c53c-49b6-4fa0-a040-48229656c8a7","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58152.14468359839778606.9e6e7f7a-1cbd-4014-9079-c80741e5d745.e535f0a1-7705-4fde-945a-7ace4558f12a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4607.14468359839778606.9e6e7f7a-1cbd-4014-9079-c80741e5d745.fd988af6-52ed-490e-bb1d-a3f687cead11","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26936.14468359839778606.9e6e7f7a-1cbd-4014-9079-c80741e5d745.5fa9f801-d484-4c2b-9ff8-9b9252def750","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50163.14468359839778606.9e6e7f7a-1cbd-4014-9079-c80741e5d745.0dfb5a68-f7df-4f88-a230-8ee4956fa87a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17306.14468359839778606.9e6e7f7a-1cbd-4014-9079-c80741e5d745.ba77f7e2-b490-4ce2-a486-d4f739284df2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49886.14468359839778606.9e6e7f7a-1cbd-4014-9079-c80741e5d745.88e48337-3e35-46f1-9b4f-ae78528df9ea","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.401.14468359839778606.9e6e7f7a-1cbd-4014-9079-c80741e5d745.a36f0a83-962b-4786-bb55-6e186e441e1a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51499.14468359839778606.9e6e7f7a-1cbd-4014-9079-c80741e5d745.7b1adb37-807a-4176-93ca-2bd960085646"],"ReleaseDate":5248642622427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":780939264},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/broken-age/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-one"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":78},"ID":"BRT1K9FV4LRR","Title":{"en-us":"Broken Age"},"Description":{"en-us":"Broken Age is a timeless coming-of-age story of barfing trees and talking spoons.

Thrust amongst the unfamiliar and colourful inhabitants of the Eye, you need to build friendships, earn your keep, and navigate the factions of this strange metropolis, if you hope to survive to see the next cycle.\r\n\r\nROLL THE DICE. DO THE WORK. GET PAID. SURVIVE.\r\nInspired by Tabletop Roleplaying games, Citizen Sleeper uses Dice, Clocks and Drives  to create a player-led experience, where you choose your path in a rich and responsive world. Each cycle you use the dice you are dealt to choose what to do with your time. Make or break alliances, uncover truths and escape your hunters. Survive and ultimately thrive, one cycle at a time, and sometimes against the clock!\r\n\r\nTURN UP FOR YOUR FRIENDS\r\nThe station plays host to characters from all walks of life, trying to eke out an existence among the stars. Salvagers, engineers, hackers, bartenders, street-food vendors, each has a history which brought them here. You choose which of them you wish to help, and together you will shape your future.\r\n\r\nACCESS THEIR SECRETS\r\nEventually, you will learn to use your dice to hack into the station’s cloud to access decades of digital data, uncover new areas and unlock secrets. This is your unique power, and with it you can change your future. Corporate secrets, rogue AIs and troves of lost data await those willing to dive into the depths of the station’s networks.\r\n\r\nYOU WERE MADE TO DIE\r\nEssen-Arp: to them you are just property, one more asset in a portfolio that stretches across the stars. You are the product of an abusive system, in a universe where humanity’s expansion is marked by exploitation and extraction. Escape the makers of your decaying body, and chart your own path in a richly imagined, deeply relevant sci-fi world which explores ideas of precarity, personhood and freedom."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"citizen-sleeper","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36304.14019812399166283.dc5d064e-3693-46fa-896f-9287938c5df4.9b2d3ae4-15fb-4d50-a9c3-19100ae3e0ae","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24625.14019812399166283.0c3f93ec-a911-40b1-8b4c-b132fc8edd39.b1d0f34c-5ed8-47ad-a884-1a43671a375e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25059.14019812399166283.0c3f93ec-a911-40b1-8b4c-b132fc8edd39.ffb6fc1e-0d28-484e-b21e-c76eefe2662a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17309.14019812399166283.0c3f93ec-a911-40b1-8b4c-b132fc8edd39.328fcd9e-702e-4d02-9241-8397ad563525","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12203.14019812399166283.5202d2e0-b9e5-4ab3-8b20-564378356c83.226d0de1-74c1-422e-86c3-9e6b076f01ab","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48132.14019812399166283.0c3f93ec-a911-40b1-8b4c-b132fc8edd39.b688fc8d-a5fe-4596-99a8-01a177b048f1","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63676.14019812399166283.0c3f93ec-a911-40b1-8b4c-b132fc8edd39.0590c76c-692c-460c-a6af-3e2eb8f09968","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56438.14019812399166283.0c3f93ec-a911-40b1-8b4c-b132fc8edd39.14ef461c-1f8b-471a-af90-50c9ec7d22c3","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63675.14019812399166283.5202d2e0-b9e5-4ab3-8b20-564378356c83.af0a53b6-476e-49ff-a6fb-b41612cb64f2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36704.14019812399166283.0c3f93ec-a911-40b1-8b4c-b132fc8edd39.ffd87940-7b28-46a4-97e1-abe91e00ad3a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59670.14019812399166283.5202d2e0-b9e5-4ab3-8b20-564378356c83.9f32473f-8d18-4df8-b4df-9c3d86af36ca"],"ReleaseDate":5249559614427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":1607659520},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-series-x","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Shooter"],"MetacriticUrls":{"PC":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/clone-drone-in-the-danger-zone/critic-reviews/?platform=pc"},"MetaScore":{"PC":82},"ID":"9NKHKBQJSSC3","Title":{"en":"Clone Drone in the Danger Zone"},"Description":{"en":"Clone Drone in the Danger Zone is a robot voxel slice-em-up where any part of your body can be sliced off.

See below for a personal note from the devs.  \r\n\r\nExperience and explore a surreal 1920s dreamscape a vaudevillian, film noir-inspired almost-reality.  In a world full of performance, intrigue and deception, you play as Dawn, the imaginary friend of a little girl, Didi.\r\n\r\nEvery kid’s imaginary friend is special, and you have powers that no one else does – you can walk up to a lit wall, and become your shadow.  You can shift in and out of your shadow, at any lit surface, to help Didi explore the mysteries surrounding her family. \r\n\r\nIn CONTRAST:    \t\r\n• Shift between the physical 3D world and the 2D shadow world (become your shadow!)\r\n• Experience a new story and world, exploring adult themes through a child’s eyes\r\n• Solve mind-bending puzzles\r\n• Manipulate light sources and real-world objects to create unique shadow landscapes\r\n• Immerse yourself in a lush world of cabaret singers, circus performers, and magic\r\n\r\nSome talk about CONTRAST:\r\n• IGN: Best Indie at E3 2013\r\n• “It’s as if Limbo and Bioshock Infinite had a baby while watching Pan’s Labyrinth” - Venturebeat\r\n• 10 nominations at the 2014 Canadian Videogame Awards, including Game of the Year\r\n\r\nCONTRAST is developed by Compulsion Games, an 8 person indie studio in Montreal, founded on making creative, passionate and high quality games.\r\n\r\nDev note: Hi everyone! Thanks for checking out CONTRAST.  We’re really excited about the Xbox One version.  It is the tightest version of the game we’ve made, and has had the advantage of the improvements that we’ve made since the initial launch of the game and the power of the Xbox One (believe it or not, dynamic shadows make for a pretty power hungry game).\r\n\r\nWe made this game because we wanted to make something different.  We wanted a simple, mature story – something that’s not “congratulations, here’s a fancy sword, go save the world!” – based around a mechanic that hadn’t been seen before.  If you like games that are different or unique, set in different time periods, with unusual stories or new mechanics, then this might be a good game for you.  If you like super-hard platformers, this isn’t that type of game.\r\n\r\nThe average play time is roughly 4-5 hours, but it’s like most games based around puzzles – some of you will complete it faster or take longer to explore the world.

No checkpoints. You either vanquish the final boss in one go, or you try again. However, you keep some of your progress for successive runs; new paths you’ve unlocked, access to new levels, mutations, abilities and weapons.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of weapons, Dead Cells features a plethora of ways to slay your enemies. A large variety of swords, bows and of course spells, but also whips, grenades and turrets, each one with its own unique twist. Plus, mutations and scrolls allow you to build and customize your character differently with each and every run.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day though, it’s YOUR skills as a player that matter most! Roguelites are about constantly sharpening your skills, until what was an insurmountable obstacle becomes a walk in the park.

In DEATHLOOP, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop.\r\n\r\nIF AT FIRST YOU DON’T SUCCEED... DIE, DIE AGAIN \r\nEvery new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you’ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you’ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted.\r\n\r\nSINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER \r\nAre you the hero or the villain? You’ll experience DEATHLOOP’s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you’ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you’re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna’s stylish sneakers and invade another player’s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign.\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND OF BLACKREEF – PARADISE OR PRISON    \r\nArkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. DEATHLOOP will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.

Gather your Evilness in new and dynamic ways and unleash it upon the lush green forests and plains of the Overworld to turn them over to the dark side. But make sure that your Dungeon is well-secured by traps and defended by your creatures, for those pesky Overworlders won’t just twiddle their thumbs while you turn their land into the Absolute Evil’s most pleasurable holiday paradise. \r\n\r\nBut what is that noise? “Gold, gold, gold and gems, gold and gems and gold!” The ancient song echoes throughout the underworld, accompanied by the clanging steel of hammers and axes. The Dwarves have arrived to claim their share of the abundant resources and together with the Elves and Humans of the Overworld, they send out their raiding parties to find the Dungeon’s heart.\r\n\r\nDungeons 4 keeps the spirit of its predecessor, but everything is now bigger, better, and with even more dynamic Evilness™.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n• Everything is better with Dwarves™: The Dwarves have arrived to build their underground strongholds and the hardy little fellows (although they don’t like being called that) compete with the Ever-Expanding Evil for space and resources.\r\n\r\n• It makes your Dungeon great again: Dungeons are up four times larger than before and there are many more creatures who wait for the All-Commanding Evil’s orders to conquer the Overworld. Now the time has come for massive armies and truly sprawling dungeons!\r\n\r\n• Ripe for the taking: The Overworld is bigger than ever before. Gain Evilness by beating Mini Bosses like the obsessively harmonious Unicorn and use it to transform the Overworld into stunning biomes of pure evil. \r\n\r\n• New and shiny: An ability-based Perk system for Thalya, the Absolute Evil’s trusted *cough* and most loyal subordinate, grants her impressive new powers. The Absolute Evil can now enjoy taking over the world, governing the creatures and slapping subordinates even more with the customizable Evil Hand.\r\n\r\n• Minions, everywhere: The Horde, the Undead and the Demons wait to do the Absolute Evil’s bidding, with more creatures than ever eagerly following the gesturing Evil’s orders, and Snots will play a much more prominent role this time.\r\n\r\n• Many ways to tell the story: A long campaign, narrated by the beloved English Narrator from previous titles, as well as several skirmish maps all to challenge your rule as the Absolute Evil.\r\n\r\n• Change the world: Spread your Evilness across the Overworld to bring lush and green environments over to the dark side, now shining even more vibrantly and beautifully evil as you spread your evilness across many new biomes.\r\n\r\n• Work together, slay together: 2-player co-op multiplayer with both players managing one Dungeon together. All maps from the campaign and the skirmish mode are playable in co-op."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"dungeons-4","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52831.13827839494641912.fbfb4c20-fe86-40e3-888a-d19efc580378.43737932-4388-4a3d-82eb-741fa80387ba","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11129.13827839494641912.b3697916-801b-44c0-acc4-8dd2365dc7e9.d8bee18c-a3d5-4b03-94e4-9049bae3362c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50450.13827839494641912.b3697916-801b-44c0-acc4-8dd2365dc7e9.42b8df96-caaf-4bff-aada-2a5ab73c0e7f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59165.13827839494641912.b3697916-801b-44c0-acc4-8dd2365dc7e9.a410c7a9-35d1-4461-ba6f-8e9028e01af9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58873.13827839494641912.b3697916-801b-44c0-acc4-8dd2365dc7e9.4adf1815-9e4e-4c12-9ec3-644acba62ce5","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60433.13827839494641912.b3697916-801b-44c0-acc4-8dd2365dc7e9.4a2a1a94-9c21-4ff6-85e2-6aed1777daae","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33755.13827839494641912.b3697916-801b-44c0-acc4-8dd2365dc7e9.dbb2456f-6169-4c66-b1a4-b2dc839dbc65","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8235.13827839494641912.b3697916-801b-44c0-acc4-8dd2365dc7e9.1cffd5a1-22b8-4293-8288-0c3390d67fdc","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31837.13827839494641912.b3697916-801b-44c0-acc4-8dd2365dc7e9.ad9a3aa3-529d-414d-ac02-0837cdb24a8b"],"ReleaseDate":5250036866427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":15598006272},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Simulation","Sports"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxSeriesX":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/fifa-23/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-series-x"},"MetaScore":{"XboxSeriesX":79},"ID":"9NDDMHZRZ0R6","Title":{"en":"EA SPORTS™ FIFA 23 Standard Edition Xbox One"},"Description":{"en":"Experience the pinnacle of women’s international football in EA SPORTS™ FIFA 23 with the FIFA Women’s World Cup Australia and New Zealand 2023™ available on June 27th at no additional cost*.

By dint of sword, and by way of magical objects known as “rune-lenses,” the land’s history has been shaped by the alliances and aggressions of the humans, beastmen, elves, and desert people who live there.\r\n\r\nThe Galdean Empire has edged out other nations and discovered a technology that amplifies the rune-lenses’ magic.\r\n\r\nNow, the Empire is scouring the continent for an artifact that will expand their power even further. It is on one such expedition that Seign Kesling, a young and gifted imperial officer, and Nowa, a boy from a remote village, meet each other and become friends.\r\n\r\nHowever, a twist of fate will soon drag them into the fires of war, and force them both to reexamine everything they believe to be right and true.\r\n\r\nEiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes became the #1 funded Kickstarter video game of 2020 thanks to phenomenal support from the community. 505 Games is truly honored to publish Eiyuden Chronicle and work with Rabbit & Bear to help deliver a memorable gaming experience to fans.

The arrest of a friend meant he had no choice but to put on his giant metal fist and fight against those oppressing him. Little did he know that he would soon be caught up in a maelstrom of conspiracies involving the Legion, the Resistance, and the Rat Gang. \r\n\r\n●Seamless Maps Filled with Challenges to Explore \r\n\r\nExplore more than a dozen unique areas in a Action Platformer style map. The core combat, puzzle-solving, and platform mechanics are complemented by countless hidden rooms, secret passages, and shortcuts, with all kinds of rewarding challenges for players to complete. \r\nMaps are loaded on the fly to avoid frequent transitions, making the massive Torch City feel even more detailed and alive. \r\n\r\n●An Arcade Combat System with Seamless Switching between Three Weapons \r\n\r\nThe Fist, Drill, and Whip are three weapons with completely different fighting styles that offer seamless switching between high combo, high damage, and long range attacks. Pummel the enemy by choosing the most appropriate form of attack for the situation. \r\nPlayers will be challenged by dozens of distinct types of enemies, each with their own weapons and attacks, all working together to bring the player down. Unique bosses with unusual fighting styles provide a new and unique gaming experience. \r\n\r\n●Diesel-punk Aesthetics Crafted with Unreal Engine 4 \r\n\r\nThe game's diesel-punk aesthetics were inspired by diesel combustion engines that were blended with an Eastern cityscape from a bygone era to give Torch City a signature one-of-a-kind visual feel. The stark contrast between furry animals and sterile mechanical soldiers introduce the theme of conflict in the game story. \r\nThe realistic 3D visuals powered by Unreal Engine 4 combined with Physically-Based Rendering take the Action Platformer genre to a whole new level of graphics quality."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"fist-forged-in-shadow-torch","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52501.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.c4e8a5c6-16be-42e1-8ab4-3dd248750581","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11328.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.1b18322f-e441-4982-bc93-244dc075964e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16573.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.11683921-9caf-4f62-a7c8-0b3343e3f98b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12785.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.11e856bc-236c-4999-a0c9-05ae2ca46036","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55429.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.bde350f0-b3dd-485a-9d92-de32aeafc633","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2965.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.9c1a60cb-594c-41be-ad4f-98f55d03db8f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3941.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.c8027e71-a64f-4eb0-be90-1c455825fd8e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19368.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.f37c278c-ea22-46e0-8966-417b2f230b09","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53547.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.6ac996d5-19ee-4b1c-a025-c4b3f017899e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3768.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.bc0a3eba-3de1-470c-b85b-7d089f290634","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18867.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.e5955839-ae66-44cb-9f61-4e77b9089a5e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44969.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.d1e7595c-5a1c-48fd-8e2d-1f3ef6af462c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28930.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.25f47c65-2da1-41a6-bd47-a79c41a3dd66","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51444.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.a7cf3da1-0549-4411-994a-8a0dc28b78b1","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58141.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.ffcd9340-6f64-4035-bdce-ad77f0e31a8b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55440.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.14372f89-25cd-4cf0-be3f-380e3a237cd9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46976.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.426d3e81-b8a7-402d-9c1f-ff079299518e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62201.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.2794f885-137e-44c4-adb4-743a4f7ecca9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13019.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.ba9e6109-175d-462d-a064-934e81cb5eda","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25070.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.91465394-cc5f-4fca-aae9-935aae32e42c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52693.14477047788624377.9b153575-973f-45aa-bf33-80824c0a7dab.56bc4942-a88b-4725-8641-273595221cff"],"ReleaseDate":5249920226427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":22277074944},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Racing & flying","Simulation","Sports"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxSeriesX":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/f1-22/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-series-x"},"MetaScore":{"XboxSeriesX":81},"ID":"9NSDMZDFNLD4","Title":{"en":"F1® 22 Xbox One"},"Description":{"en":"Enter the new era of Formula 1® in EA SPORTS™ F1® 22, the official videogame of the 2022 FIA Formula One World Championship™.

In this open-world galactic sandbox, how you play is up to you! Bring your friends into the frontier in your own private server, or make new friends (and enemies) in large public multiplayer servers. Play peacefully in co-op, or use the dynamic multiplayer faction system to band together and split apart dynamically as allegiances change.\r\n\r\nBuild ships from scratch and travel to new planets. Your first planet is where you’ll learn to survive, but that’s just the start. Build your very own starship and use it to colonise new worlds. It won’t be easy, and only the most successful colonies will be able to pool the resources and knowledge necessary to break orbit. Once you launch, the stars hold brand-new planets, new biomes, bosses and challenges.\r\n\r\nCraft, research, loot and exploit your environment. You’ll need to prepare to take on this hostile part of the galaxy. Get mining, farming, growing, developing, researching, and building hundreds of different items, from winter combat gear to advanced laboratories. Find something you can’t work out for yourself. Strap on your handcrafted laser rifle and venture out into the unknown to explore dungeons, procedural bases, NPC stores and much more.\r\n\r\nDefend what you’ve built, or take on the galaxy. Defend your colony with fast-paced combat that utilizes physics like bullet drop, projectile speed and spread. Thwart enemy raids on your base with your stock of handcrafted grenades. Tired of just defending? Lay waste to enemy bases with destructible terrain as you wield everything from rusty old carbines to nuke launchers and energy weapons that harness the power of lightning!\r\n\r\nDevelop and construct advanced bases for protection. Grow from a tiny outpost into an advanced, nuclear-powered fortress. Manage resources carefully and choose research paths based on the items and challenges you encounter on each planet. Watch out, though: the bigger your colony gets, the more of a target it becomes for raiders (and jealous friends).\r\n\r\nAutomate work and train up a team. Even out here, you’re not alone. Save AI survivors and build a colony together. A range of unique stats, perks and flaws mean every colonist has something different to contribute. As your AI colonists complete tasks they’ll level up and get smarter, stronger and faster. Best of all, you can assign tasks and orders to NPCs to do the grunt work for you and prioritize their roles based on those skills. Want to take a break from mining to destroy an underground alien nest? Let your colonists handle that for you!\r\n\r\nAnd Remember\r\n\r\nYour ship may be in ruins, your ammunition running low, and your teammates scattered across the surface, but remember this:\r\n\r\nYou’re more than just another adventurous spirit.\r\n\r\nYou’re a Farworld Pioneer."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"farworld-pioneers","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10675.13881713022499400.de0661f6-d8cd-4a88-af6f-82edd085e4df.23dfb2ce-9c92-4553-a010-dbf2df548a6c","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24063.13881713022499400.839344ce-bb9a-4f19-959d-5fa559a20f84.31a9deb0-fd78-481e-a4e1-3ff881064fcc","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17848.13881713022499400.839344ce-bb9a-4f19-959d-5fa559a20f84.ff59ce34-4d8e-4950-ba29-1e5ad433a36e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58559.13881713022499400.839344ce-bb9a-4f19-959d-5fa559a20f84.b861b28a-7aff-4569-ace4-870008529b90","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35632.13881713022499400.839344ce-bb9a-4f19-959d-5fa559a20f84.20cff597-838c-42f6-81b2-21c7a7e452a4","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40649.13881713022499400.839344ce-bb9a-4f19-959d-5fa559a20f84.c9f2652f-f058-4301-8958-898a8b150bb2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51384.13881713022499400.839344ce-bb9a-4f19-959d-5fa559a20f84.298252af-5f48-4488-90aa-cd4903604e72","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13229.13881713022499400.839344ce-bb9a-4f19-959d-5fa559a20f84.5df9dde4-c729-4351-bee5-c6d6d0ec7fcd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60172.13881713022499400.839344ce-bb9a-4f19-959d-5fa559a20f84.1415b57b-0388-474a-948b-b68556283693"],"ReleaseDate":5249896610427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":1733214208},"MetacriticPlatform":null,"AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/fe/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-one"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":70},"ID":"BZW2R4STVDNK","Title":{"en-us":"Fe"},"Description":{"en-us":"Fe is a new type of platform adventure where the story is up to you to discover, without handholding, told wordlessly through the discoveries you make during gameplay.\r\n\r\nRun, climb and glide your way through a dark Nordic forest and explore its living, breathing ecosystem filled with secrets and mystical creatures.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the experience is a tactile, analogue song mechanic that allows you to communicate and speak to every living thing in the forest.\r\n\r\nLearn a diverse array of animal cries that allow you to befriend or manipulate any creature - even plants.

The Haunted Island is the first in this award-winning series, and this bite-sized mystery is what started an international cult obsession with the world of Frog Detective.\r\n\r\nIn the second mystery, The Case of the Invisible Wizard, we follow the Detective to Warlock Woods, where a celebratory parade for their newest neighbor has been maliciously destroyed. Now the neighbor is nowhere to be seen, and the town is in ruin. Can Frog Detective get to the bottom of things? We sure hope so, otherwise the game would be a bummer.\r\n\r\nIn the exciting series finale, Corruption at Cowboy County, The Detective and Lobster Cop are tasked to solve the conundrum of a sheriff-less town. But not all is as it seems here, when a surprisingly simple solution to the case reveals a sinister scheme. Maybe crime is real after all...\r\nThis final mystery is jam-packed with twists and turns, a true love letter to the Frog Detective fans.\r\n\r\nFrog Detective: The Entire Mystery is a family-friendly yet witty take on the detective game genre. Solve the mysteries on your own, or play along with friends as you take turns reading out the dialogue. Think you can crack the case?\r\n\r\nGame languages: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish (Latin America), Portuguese (Brazil)."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"frog-detective-the-entire-mystery","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1430.13922992293403127.6f30e52d-8a3d-4bd4-832f-747b967ec44e.715746bc-db0c-4ba6-8653-99bba5d3f90a","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59390.13922992293403127.6f30e52d-8a3d-4bd4-832f-747b967ec44e.5a9e35e2-f122-4eb2-831a-a81f1ca4657a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54463.13922992293403127.6f30e52d-8a3d-4bd4-832f-747b967ec44e.c36bea25-c0ee-4c84-9d80-6e509bf2d32d","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1928.13922992293403127.6f30e52d-8a3d-4bd4-832f-747b967ec44e.0990be25-2b80-4aa9-a519-8da33aa38bc2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42671.13922992293403127.6f30e52d-8a3d-4bd4-832f-747b967ec44e.b13a2059-44bb-4af7-b51c-1d5040cfa52b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23085.13922992293403127.6f30e52d-8a3d-4bd4-832f-747b967ec44e.06f61c9e-15fb-42f9-9f2d-2dfe23de0e30","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3925.13922992293403127.6f30e52d-8a3d-4bd4-832f-747b967ec44e.e0e824cc-c574-4273-9c30-8d13a2c80035","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24206.13922992293403127.6f30e52d-8a3d-4bd4-832f-747b967ec44e.5284a5a2-5a5b-4526-a29d-d6acd9b57f02"],"ReleaseDate":5250024770427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":716812288},"MetacriticPlatform":"playstation-5","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{},"MetaScore":{},"ID":"9PLK75782446","Title":{"en":"From Space"},"Description":{"en":"That's no bubblegum army, that's an endless horde of menacingly pink aliens taking over our planet! Enough sweet talk, grab your gear, we need you and your squad to defeat the pink pests!\r\n \r\nYOUR MISSION: Liberate Earth from the Alien horde!\r\n\r\nHORDE MODE\r\nWe have an emergency on our hands! Resistance is a high-energy “Horde Mode” where you and your (extremely qualified) team will be deployed into unique locations, completing objectives, while surviving waves of pink life forms that increase in difficulty. It’s down to you to save the world. \r\n \r\nCollect Tokens to unlock weapons, items, and perks to boost your stats and build the ultimate loadout based on your playstyle.

Get out there and make us proud, recruit! \r\n \r\nSTORY MODE\r\nIt’s time to save the world! Embark on a journey to meet fellow earthlings that require your assistance, you virtuoso. You’ll be completing a wide range of exciting missions, usually, through chaotic combat, and yes, you have full permission to destroy everything in your path. \r\n \r\nMISSION TIP #1: Squad Up!\r\nWhile you can play From Space solo (if you're brave enough) you'd be wise to invite some friends to help you out. With online play you can create a four-person squad. Look, there's a lot of those pink pests out there so the more people, the better. Oh, and with a squad, you'll have some witnessess to tell everyone how awesome you are. It's basically a win-win scenario.\r\n \r\nMISSION TIP #2: Shoot, Explode & Stab\r\nWith a variety of weapons (Rocket Launchers, Miniguns, Flamethrowers and more!) there’s no excuse not to annihilate those aliens! Build your ideal spec and use tactical items such as grenades and mines, or slow down the hordes with barbed wire and machinegun turrets. Remember to scavenge the world for loot, you'll need it!\r\n\r\nMISSION TIP #3: You’re special, so pick your specialist skill!\r\nNo matter what type of player you are, there’s a wide range of characters in From Space's roster, each with their own unique ability and weapons. Find the perfect balance with your friends as you build the ultimate super squad.\r\n \r\nMISSION TIP #4: Don’t just stand there, Level-up!\r\nAs you level-up, you’ll be able to attach special perks to your character, helping you to master the art of destroying aliens. You'll need to find ways to combat increasingly more powerful aliens, and perks will help you accomplish all of your pink alien squashing dreams. Need to rethink your strategy? No problem! We like innovators! Perks can be swapped around, even between your squad!\r\n\r\nMISSION TIP 5#: The apocalypse has never been so much fun... so have fun!\r\nWe’re going to level with you... an alien threat is terrifying, terrifyingly fun! Look, the world is already pretty beat up as it is. Who's going to notice if you cause a little bit more destruction while saving the day? People have insurance it's fine...\r\n"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"from-space","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16759.14311843146455225.858b9bb0-aedd-46ab-907b-4002100e6620.36f89050-9225-4e01-9aec-06d3b388bca4","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":false,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":false,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2961.14311843146455225.858b9bb0-aedd-46ab-907b-4002100e6620.377f4b86-0180-477a-9f4e-24183700e01a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10729.14311843146455225.858b9bb0-aedd-46ab-907b-4002100e6620.6fe810f4-9311-44a5-b57d-83a3768cbc41","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50633.14311843146455225.858b9bb0-aedd-46ab-907b-4002100e6620.dbbb3ea2-a4b6-4f98-8c8c-c1fae5ba78ea","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48037.14311843146455225.858b9bb0-aedd-46ab-907b-4002100e6620.f258b2ee-fbc3-40db-ac2a-fbc29ad6ea32","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28008.14311843146455225.858b9bb0-aedd-46ab-907b-4002100e6620.adc07a8a-0fdb-432f-ab81-db21d374b1bb","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53069.14311843146455225.858b9bb0-aedd-46ab-907b-4002100e6620.b421b2d4-e802-4650-b315-927af006b243","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60533.14311843146455225.858b9bb0-aedd-46ab-907b-4002100e6620.857eb534-6590-43f6-9765-29896ab1398b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34158.14311843146455225.858b9bb0-aedd-46ab-907b-4002100e6620.4a411284-e3f9-48ca-b429-4f47e2286167","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44339.14311843146455225.858b9bb0-aedd-46ab-907b-4002100e6620.173ff620-89a1-4c6f-bfdb-724b90ebd01e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27504.14311843146455225.858b9bb0-aedd-46ab-907b-4002100e6620.5d85155d-7aaf-487f-934d-566e3574f81d"],"ReleaseDate":5250012998427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":4214198272},"MetacriticPlatform":null,"AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Simulation","Strategy"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/frostpunk-console-edition/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-one"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":84},"ID":"9NP539LHJD8S","Title":{"en":"Frostpunk: Console Edition"},"Description":{"en":"PLAY FROSTPUNK: CONSOLE EDITION\r\nThis version of the award-winning game from 11 bit studios is tailored to give console players the full Frostpunk experience:\r\n\r\n•\tThanks to the special, dedicated controller scheme all important features of the game are quickly within your reach.\r\n•\tThe Console Edition of the game already includes all the updates that have been released since its premiere on PC.\r\n\r\nTHE CITY MUST SURVIVE\r\n\r\nOffering players a complex strategic challenge alongside a rich narrative featuring an alternative take on the 19th-century industrial revolution, Frostpunk weaves a story of how our planet mysteriously freezes, putting an end to civilization as we know it and forcing the human race to adapt to the harsh conditions. As the leader of possibly the last civilized society on Earth, you’re going to build the city your survivors live in, discover new technologies, explore frozen wastelands and most importantly, manage and rule society to prepare it for life in an unforgiving world. Whether you’re an enlightened ruler or an iron-fisted tyrant, you’ll discover choices in this world aren’t as easy as they seem, and that holding power over people has a cost as heavy as the responsibility you feel in caring for them.\r\n\r\nSHAPE YOUR SOCIETY\r\nEstablish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. \r\n\r\nShould you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless.\r\n\r\nEXPAND AND EXPLORE\r\nSurvival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills.\r\n\r\nWhile New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.\r\n"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"frostpunk-console-edition","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60016.13729671074412623.f72f7df4-e873-4e52-a4dc-651d0b3e8b0f.cc8acfbd-41d0-4e59-a807-5140924e9378","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18335.13729671074412623.f72f7df4-e873-4e52-a4dc-651d0b3e8b0f.d571ee33-c8af-452c-8e85-ac20bd5979b1","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52305.13729671074412623.f72f7df4-e873-4e52-a4dc-651d0b3e8b0f.401dccb8-1e0f-4160-97a3-504b982ab223","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13158.13729671074412623.f72f7df4-e873-4e52-a4dc-651d0b3e8b0f.fbd16426-0d2d-4c9b-9454-2d34b1824c9c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48001.13729671074412623.f72f7df4-e873-4e52-a4dc-651d0b3e8b0f.670fc54a-40c4-41ad-bb9a-19132d9501ce","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28894.13729671074412623.f72f7df4-e873-4e52-a4dc-651d0b3e8b0f.bc14d943-1c9c-4f20-b075-74091fe310c7","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60706.13729671074412623.f72f7df4-e873-4e52-a4dc-651d0b3e8b0f.ee804a31-b783-4664-ad93-79a4ecdfafa0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56425.13729671074412623.f72f7df4-e873-4e52-a4dc-651d0b3e8b0f.b40443b8-52ea-43f6-ac30-b090993486fa","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42073.13729671074412623.aa803b1b-7693-4bf1-a3b8-519632313b08.8335f660-dda2-403e-a468-84fedcef7eaa","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52305.13729671074412623.f72f7df4-e873-4e52-a4dc-651d0b3e8b0f.401dccb8-1e0f-4160-97a3-504b982ab223"],"ReleaseDate":5248750010427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":6196576256},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-one","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Role playing"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxSeriesX":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/fuga-melodies-of-steel-2/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-series-x"},"MetaScore":{"XboxSeriesX":86},"ID":"9P5CK72457WF","Title":{"en":"Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2"},"Description":{"en":"A year has passed since the events of Fuga: Melodies of Steel.

Inspired by timeless classic ARPG's such as Diablo 2 and Titan Quest, Ghostlore features a detailed item and character customization system, procedurally generated maps, and authentic 90's retro graphics.\n\nLORE COMES TO LIFE\nThe bloodthirsty Penanggal is a gruesome creature with origins in Malay folklore. It comprises of nothing more than a disembodied head and dangling entrails. The Indonesian Babi Ngepet myth tells of sorcerors who sacrifice their humanity in order to become boar demons. The tales of Hungry Ghosts are superstitions brought over by Chinese immigrants - undead horrors cursed to remain forever hungry due to their greed in mortal life.\n\nStories from the maritime region of Southeast-Asia are full of all manner of nightmarish, horrifying creatures. Are you brave enough to face them? Discover over 40 different enemies, each with their quirks and tactics to defeat based on their descriptions in folklore.\n\nA WORLD LIKE NO OTHER\nExplore a procedurally generated world that takes inspiration from the developers' home country of Singapore, its two closest neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia, and the rest of Southeast Asia.\n\nPlayers unfamiliar with the region will get to experience a culture that is underrepresented and rarely seen in other forms of media. Players who live in Southeast Asia will find plenty of things they recognize - such as the food! Collect and prepare various meals to boost your stats. Don't fight on an empty stomach!\n\nMULTI CLASS SYSTEM\nGhostlore allows you to mix-and-match abilities from 3 out of 6 character classes to create your own unique hero. The 6 classes are:\n• The Adept: Mystic warriors skilled in Martial Arts, honing their mind as well as their body.\n• The Exorcist: Able to sense the spirit world with ESP and cast out evil spirits.\n• The Feral: Fearless fighters bestowed with the power of blood magic and the ability to transform into a Weretiger.\n• The Geomancer: Masters of the art of bending the elemental forces of Earth, Fire, Ice and Lightning to their will.\n• The Hashashin: Shadowy assassins who rely on speed and stealth to take down opponents.\n• The Sentinel: Keepers of the forest with the ability to communicate with animals.\n\nBUILD YOUR OWN SKILL TREES WITH THE SKILL LINK SYSTEM\nEach class comes with a “skill set”, a pool containing active skills, skill modifiers, and passive class bonuses. Skills must be assigned to a grid in order to be usable. More grid spaces unlock as you level up. Things can be placed in or taken out of the grid at will.\n\nSkill modifiers can be used to change the characteristics of any active skill from any class. Skill modifiers link together with active skills both across and down. (see green highlighted area in image). Some skill modifiers have tradeoffs.\n\nSome skill modifiers are trigger modifiers. Trigger modifiers allow a skill to be used automatically, as long as there is enough MP, the skill is not on cooldown, and the modifier’s specified conditions are met.\n\nCOMBO SKILLS\nEach active skill is also able to combine with skills from other classes to form an advanced skill that incorporates the characteristics of both base skills. Combo skills are created when two compatible skills are placed adjacent to one another in the skill grid.\n\nGLYPH SYSTEM\nThe Glyph system is where Ghostlore brings something truly new to the Action-RPG table. In your travels you will find Glyphs - magical symbols that you can inscribe onto your body to gain new powers.Each Glyph takes up space on your body (represented in game as a grid). As your level increases, so do the number of glyphs you can inscribe onto yourself.Here's where things get interesting: Compound glyphs are rare and special glyphs that use 5 normal glyph spaces, but grant additional bonuses to glyphs that are placed within their configuration. Plan your Compound Glyph layout in order to maximise stat bonuses!In Ghostlore, you can wield a variety of weapons prevalent in Southeast-Asian martial arts:• The Kris or Keris - a blade with a distinctively wavy shape. It is a well-balanced weapon.\n• The Bow and Arrow has been a staple of hunting since the dawn of time; apparently they come in handy with ghost-hunting as well!\n• Parangs, also known as machetes, are cleaving blades with a wide arc.\n• The deadly Kukri knives are the fastest attacking melee weapons in the game.\n• The trusty Spear has the longest reach out of all the melee weapons.\n• Finally, there are enchanted Talismans that can fly and give foes nasty papercuts.\n\nIn addition, you can find and equip a variety of Amulets. Amulets are commonly sold in many parts of real world Southeast Asia as good luck charms. In the world of Ghostlore, their power is very, very real. Equipping the right Amulet for the situation can mean the difference between a glorious victory and an untimely demise.Additionally, items can be modified in a couple of unique ways:\n\nSpirits inhabiting items are the reason why some of them have magical properties. Visit the Psychic to awaken the spirits which lay dormant in items such as weapons, shields, hats, scarves and amulets. Once awakened, the spirit will ask you to settle a score. Upon fulfilment of the request, your item will strengthen with new enchantments.Based on actual Southeast Asian folklore, the Orang Bunian are nature spirits that you can meet in your travels. On rare occasion, they will bless your items with new, random properties.\n\nNEVER FIGHT ALONE\n• Local co-op multiplier lets you play with up to 4 of your friends on the same screen.\n• Modding support allows you to customise your experience with mods from the community.\n• The Shrine of Balance is an optional asynchronous multiplayer feature which lets you help other players by sending them equipment. You have better chances of good loot in return when they use your equipment.\n• The Shrine of Spirits is another optional asynchronous online multiplayer mechanic where a 'snapshot' of another player's current character (also known as their 'Ghost Data') can be temporarily summoned into the your own game as an ally NPC.\n\nENDLESS CHALLENGES\nMission Mode: Undertake randomized missions after completing the campaign. Unlock Map Data, which allows you to modify missions and change the odds more to your favour.

You no longer have to fantasize about being a goat, your dreams have finally come true! \r\n\r\nGameplay-wise, Goat Simulator is all about causing as much destruction as you possibly can as a goat. It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. Destroy things with style, such as doing a backflip while headbutting a bucket through a window, and you'll earn even more points! When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\nGoat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n• You can be a goat \r\n• Get points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends that you're the alpha goat \r\n• MILLIONS OF BUGS! We're only eliminating the crash-bugs, everything else is hilarious and we're keeping it \r\n• In-game physics that bug out all the time \r\n• Seriously look at that goat's neck \r\n• You can be a goat"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"goat-simulator","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36875.70628353720390187.c5ec2284-1a6e-4ed0-a094-b54b14b8d466.cebea296-f07d-484e-bdf5-f6840555bf02","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52810.70628353720390187.c5ec2284-1a6e-4ed0-a094-b54b14b8d466.3fd50c63-c2d2-482e-bb0d-1ebe01bbd5f9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38783.70628353720390187.c5ec2284-1a6e-4ed0-a094-b54b14b8d466.0d392668-a6ad-4a32-9515-eed7c7a96bcb","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49933.70628353720390187.c5ec2284-1a6e-4ed0-a094-b54b14b8d466.d9ec9b0f-62eb-4794-bc2c-e879b1d55558","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59785.70628353720390187.c5ec2284-1a6e-4ed0-a094-b54b14b8d466.118f9904-f3bc-4eac-9e88-2e0357ce5e1b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17605.70628353720390187.c5ec2284-1a6e-4ed0-a094-b54b14b8d466.eb3253f2-22b8-4e18-9d8e-01cfed00ddc6","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28595.70628353720390187.c5ec2284-1a6e-4ed0-a094-b54b14b8d466.f93f4218-9baa-4f5a-a0fa-9eb449391730","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18894.70628353720390187.c5ec2284-1a6e-4ed0-a094-b54b14b8d466.7f829864-22c9-4b0b-ba69-ed55ce51656e","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.647.70628353720390187.c5ec2284-1a6e-4ed0-a094-b54b14b8d466.5bd0341f-5b8e-470a-ab97-40728c0afb26","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37942.70628353720390187.c5ec2284-1a6e-4ed0-a094-b54b14b8d466.2601e3fb-bc80-4f9f-aec3-25e44d080208","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43618.70628353720390187.c5ec2284-1a6e-4ed0-a094-b54b14b8d466.a19c1d3b-e0bf-4d29-a5b4-3c0b31e78904"],"ReleaseDate":5247334274427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":3241246720},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-one","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Simulation","Action & adventure","Family & kids"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxSeriesX":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/goat-simulator-3/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-series-x"},"MetaScore":{"XboxSeriesX":78},"ID":"9NMB4T25W817","Title":{"en":"Goat Simulator 3"},"Description":{"en":"Pilgor’s baaack!  \r\n\r\nGather your herd and venture forth into Goat Simulator 3; an all-new, totally realistic, sandbox farmyard experience that puts you back in the hooves of no one's favourite female protagonist. \r\n\r\nThat’s right – we’re doing this again.

Hell Let Loose drops you into the action, where you will have to fight across fields, bridges, forests, towns and more war-torn environments! Lumbering tanks will be dominating the battlefield and crucial supply chains fuelling the frontlines, you are essential to the colossal, combined arms warfare. \r\n\r\nTake to the battlefield in this squad-based, 50v50 multiplayer game, and choose one of our 14 roles available within the Command, Infantry, Recon and Armour unit types. Play as an Officer, Spotter, Medic, Tank Commander and more, to experience every aspect of World War II combat. Each role is equipped with different historical weapons, vehicles, and equipment that are intricately detailed, bringing the realism to the brutal and bloody warfare. Unit focussed gameplay is crucial and when done well can command the tide of battle. \r\n\r\nThe combat takes place across huge, to-scale maps, recreated by utilising aerial and satellite imagery of real battle locations  in stunning detail using Unreal Engine 4. These realistic battlefields are divided up into large capture sectors allowing emergent and constantly unique gameplay to evolve between the two forces of fifty players. Work as a team and make continual large scale, tactical decisions as to where to attack or defend.\r\n\r\nManage resources and supplies to call in support, bombing runs, new vehicles, strafing runs and to reinforce strong-points or flank enemies. When a sector is captured, it will generate one of three resources for your team, creating a complex game that will influence your team’s march to victory. Strategy is key to success.\r\n\r\nHell Let Loose is not about kill to death ratios – teamwork is central to gameplay. Communication is essential.

depth (and humour!). Embark on an ever-changing journey, build your own bestiary, defeat medieval superstars and collect perks to unleash special powers.\r\n\r\nBecome a master of the Living Ink, grab your quill and build your unique strategy time after time so that you can be named the greatest Inkulinati of all time!\r\n\r\nINKULINATI IS INSPIRED BY REAL-LIFE MEDIEVAL MARGINALIA\r\n700 years in the making, finally these bizarre art pieces can come alive in a video game and show that medieval people also had their “memes” and that they laughed from the same silly things that we do today. You’ll see sword-wielding rabbits, dogs with spears, trumpets lodged in bottoms, human-eating snails, and more. Much, much more…\r\n\r\nFIGHT LIKE AN INKULINATI\r\nInkulinati are a legendary group who battle one another on the pages of medieval manuscripts. They fight by drawing Beasts with the Living Ink. Thanks to this magical substance, those creatures come to life and an epic battle ensues.Move your Beasts across the battlefield, perform actions on or with them, make tactical use of obstacles and collect more Living Ink to draw new Beasts which allows you to gain an advantage over your opponent.\r\n\r\nMULTIPLE DEADLY (AND BIZARRE) BEASTS TO UNLOCK\r\nDonkeys playing trumpets with their bottoms, bishop cats vanquishing heretics with prayers, heavy but deadly snails that eat units alive, and more. Much, much more. They all have their special skills and are waiting for your command.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL, BATTLE TIDE-TURNING ACTIONS PERFORMED BY THE INKULINATI\r\nIt’s not just your Beasts that can cause havoc and damage. Use your fists to smash your opponent's units, draw obstacles to create barriers, relocate your units with a move of your finger, or explode your troops to create pure, pure chaos. Just remember - your opponent can do it too.\r\n\r\nADAPT YOUR TACTIC TO EVERY BATTLE\r\nEach Inkulinati has its own army, with different Beasts, who in turn, have different abilities, strengths, and unfortunately, weaknesses (or fortunately - depending which side you’re on). But it’s not just the armies that can influence who will win any given duel. Each Battlefield is its own domain, with its own particular dangers that you should watch out for, and opportunities that you can use. You will have to use your wits and adapt your strategy to beat the opposing Inkulinati’s army on each specific Battlefield.\r\n\r\nA SINGLE-PLAYER CAMPAIGN\r\nUncover the mystery and secrets of Inkulinati and face such opponents as Death, Dante Alighieri, and more. Go out into the world and start your adventure! Fight the biggest Inkulinati masters in the land, tame the untamed Beasts, build your ultimate army, try to bring back your Master from the clutches of death, and most importantly, finish your grand quest with the biggest party that the middle ages have ever seen! Howza!!!\r\n\r\nCREATE AND DEVELOP YOUR OWN CHARACTER\r\nAs any aspiring Inkulinati Master, you will get to create your own Tiny-Inkulinati. During your journey you will learn the secret techniques of drawing new Beasts and Inkulinati Hand Actions, allowing you to choose the composition of your army. You can be a brave knight that has no fear and will send his loyal troops straight at his opponents. Or perhaps you would like to play with a bit more tact? In that case, you can be a nun who with the power of prayer can confuse her enemies and heal thy own servants. Those styles, and more, are waiting to be discovered and made your own.

Is it a plane? It's falling too fast to be either of those. It's McPixel! A wanna-be hero who keeps getting mixed up in the most unbelievable situations you can imagine.\r\n\r\nLevels\r\nOne moment you're stuck in a speeding train headed towards the cliff; the other, you're in a falling plane. Sometimes you need to win an impossible-to-win soccer match, and the other, you're a dinosaur trying to hide from a meteorite. Stuck in a flaming house? Sandwiched between two battling armies? Certainly not a problem for McPixel! 100 levels of fast-paced action are waiting for you!\r\n\r\nMinigames\r\nSometimes, the usual adventure style will get interrupted by genre-bending minigames. Ranging from racing, shooting, fighting, and sports to even platforming or FPS! The game offers over 20 minigames scattered around the world of McPixel!\r\n\r\nCoins and stamps\r\nMcPixel is not all about just saving the day but having fun trying to come up with the craziest possible solutions. And for every solution, you will be rewarded with coins! Find all solutions in a level to get the gold prize and some extra coins! You can use them to unlock new levels! Also, everyone loves coins, right? They're shiny and golden and spinning! No reason not to have some more!\r\n\r\nMcBurg\r\nThe game takes place in the city of McBurg. Explore the city and find different adventures! Some of the paths in the city are blocked and will require you to spend coins to move forward and access new levels! The city will get populated with characters and items from the levels you already visited as you play. You will also be able to don some of the costumes you found while playing.\r\n\r\nOn the edge of the city upon a grassy hill, you can see a Devolver vault, full of gold, looming over McBurg. So, if you ever need a lot of coins, maybe it's time to pay Fork Parker a visit?\r\n\r\nSteve\r\nSometimes, during your adventures, you will find Steve. Steve can be in the weirdest and most unexpected of places, and finding him will transport you to the Steve level.\r\n\r\nSteve is not like McPixel and doesn't specialize in saving the day. He's just some guy, doing stuff. Like fishing, cooking, driving a car, or summoning demons. You know, just the average guy kind of stuff.\r\n\r\nKey Features:\r\n- 100 mind-blowing levels\r\n- Nearly 1000 hilarious gags to discover\r\n- Over 1500 interactive items\r\n- Over 20 minigames in all imaginable genres\r\n- Over 300,000,000 pixels\r\n- Steve\r\n- A water level"},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"mcpixel-3","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31201.14336879122555401.4c30f6b3-d0ef-4997-95dd-4b1a894b1874.f4a8090c-17b1-49a4-bfb9-5747db50f016","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27877.14336879122555401.4c30f6b3-d0ef-4997-95dd-4b1a894b1874.93b1ec86-3096-4f4d-a2f7-baedd49e039a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61860.14336879122555401.4c30f6b3-d0ef-4997-95dd-4b1a894b1874.3769b389-61f8-463e-8b3a-2160f73feac8","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31417.14336879122555401.4c30f6b3-d0ef-4997-95dd-4b1a894b1874.92ff14b8-26d8-45ad-ad6f-cad7c6a22a4d","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3719.14336879122555401.4c30f6b3-d0ef-4997-95dd-4b1a894b1874.82120ed7-c554-400c-a6f2-dc631f1a7298","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37772.14336879122555401.4c30f6b3-d0ef-4997-95dd-4b1a894b1874.8b50c834-2689-4953-8aa2-430fc4963fe7","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31668.14336879122555401.4c30f6b3-d0ef-4997-95dd-4b1a894b1874.e8cdd66b-ac67-4a4c-bcba-df485825736f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8592.14336879122555401.4c30f6b3-d0ef-4997-95dd-4b1a894b1874.f7fc8493-9364-46ad-9024-8274ba4f61d7","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25602.14336879122555401.4c30f6b3-d0ef-4997-95dd-4b1a894b1874.a6fcf924-7ab8-4876-9a1c-a17ab0c0572c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7623.14336879122555401.4c30f6b3-d0ef-4997-95dd-4b1a894b1874.d23d19de-1545-41ec-a90e-181fb4e77409","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42048.14336879122555401.4c30f6b3-d0ef-4997-95dd-4b1a894b1874.e8016dfd-4bd0-4e69-8aa8-4a6086055c34"],"ReleaseDate":5249726438427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":157487104},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Shooter","Simulation"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxSeriesX":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/mechwarrior-5-mercenaries/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-series-x"},"MetaScore":{"XboxSeriesX":74},"ID":"9PB86W3JK8Z5","Title":{"en":"MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries"},"Description":{"en":"BE YOUR OWN WEAPON OF WAR\r\n\r\nWelcome to the year 3015!

In Monster Hunter Rise, the latest installment in the award-winning and top-selling Monster Hunter series, you’ll become a hunter, explore brand new maps and use a variety of weapons to take down fearsome monsters as part of an all-new storyline. \r\n\r\nFerocious monsters with unique ecologies\r\nHunt down a plethora of monsters with distinct behaviors and deadly ferocity. From classic returning monsters to all-new creatures inspired by Japanese folklore, including the flagship wyvern Magnamalo, you’ll need to think on your feet and master their unique tendencies if you hope to reap any of the rewards!\r\n\r\nChoose your weapon and show your skills\r\nWield 14 different weapon types that offer unique gameplay styles, both up-close and from long range. Charge up and hit hard with the devastating Great Sword; dispatch monsters in style using the elegant Long Sword; become a deadly maelstrom of blades with the speedy Dual Blades; charge forth with the punishing Lance; or take aim from a distance with the Bow and Bowguns. These are just a few of the weapon types available in the game, meaning you’re sure to find the play style that suits you best. \r\n\r\nHunt, gather and craft your way to the top of the food chain\r\nEach monster you hunt will provide materials that allow you to craft new weapons and armor and upgrade your existing gear. Go back out on the field and hunt even fiercer monsters and earn even better rewards! You can change your weapon at any of the Equipment Boxes any time, so the possibilities are limitless!\r\n\r\nHunt solo or team up to take monsters down\r\nThe Hunter Hub offers multiplayer quests where up to four players can team up to take on targets together. Difficulty scaling ensures that whether you go solo or hit the hunt as a full four-person squad, it’s always a fair fight.\r\n\r\nEnjoy an exciting new storyline set in Kamura Village\r\nThis serene locale is inhabited by a colorful cast of villagers who have long lived in fear of the Rampage - a catastrophic event where countless monsters attack the village all at once. 50 years after the last Rampage, you must work together with the villagers to face this trial.\r\n\r\nExperience new hunting actions with the Wirebug\r\nWirebugs are an integral part of your hunter’s toolkit. The special silk they shoot out can be used to zip up walls and across maps, and can even be used to pull off special attacks unique to each of the 14 weapon types in the game.\r\n\r\nBuddies are here to help \r\nThe Palico Felyne friends you already know and love from previous Monster Hunter adventures are joined by the brand new Palamute Canyne companions!\r\n\r\nWreak havoc by controlling monsters\r\nControl raging monsters using Wyvern Riding and dish out massive damage to your targets! \r\n\r\nFend off hordes of monsters in The Rampage\r\nProtect Kamura Village from hordes of monsters in an all-new quest type!

In this corrupt gambler’s paradise, the stakes are high and The House always wins. Play a varied and challenging world of events as Tyler; the Racer, Mac; the Showman and Jess; the Wheelman. Each driver must take on races, missions and challenges to earn the respect of the Valley’s underground and compete in the ultimate race to finally take down The House. \r\n\r\nYour car is at the centre of everything you do. Craft unique rides with deeper performance and visual customization than ever before. Push them to the limit when you narrowly escape the heat in epic cop battles. Go head-to-head with other racers on or off-road through canyons, deserts, mountains, and the city. Raise the stakes by putting down additional in-game currency on all events, challenges and missions that can multiply your winnings. But you could lose it all. Finally, for ultimate bragging rights, connect and compete via Autolog recommendations with your friends and, for the first time, with potential rivals. Your leaderboard will populate with other players of similar skill level so you can see how you rank around the world.\r\n\r\nFrom insane heist missions to devastating car battles to jaw dropping set piece moments, Need for Speed™ Payback delivers an edge of your seat, adrenaline-fueled action-driving fantasy.\r\n \r\nKEY FEATURES\r\n• Scrap to Stock to Supercar: Your car is at the centre of everything you do in Need for Speed Payback.

Find abandoned derelict cars scattered throughout the world to build your perfect car from the ground up. Collect, win, or buy the hottest after-market parts and craft multiple cars into the perfect driving machines.\r\n\r\n• Live out an action-driving fantasy: Play through an explosive, action-packed adventure as three distinct playable characters united by one common goal: revenge. Tyler, Mac and Jess team up to even the score against all odds, and enter the ultimate race to take down The House. Battle cops with ever-increasing intensity, race against rivals across the city, and drive on and off-road through mountains, canyons, and desert.\r\n\r\n•High stakes competition: Get on a roll and win big with all-new Risk vs Reward gameplay. The return of intense cop chases means the stakes have never been higher.

In the hopes of finding him, you must follow a fugitive security android through the refineries, strip malls, and drainage ditches of suburban New Orleans.\r\n\r\nImmerse yourself in a surreal and uncanny South Louisiana:\r\nNORCO’s painterly and cinematic pixel art draws the player into its quotidian sci-fi world of disappearing swamplands, labyrinthine oil refineries, and other landscapes inspired by the titular town of Norco, Louisiana and other parts of Greater New Orleans.

It is subject to change before its release as a finished product. Please purchase only if you are comfortable with the game in its current state.\r\n\r\nQ. What kind of game is this?\r\nA. In this game, you can peacefully live alongside mysterious creatures known as Pals or risk your life to drive off a ruthless poaching syndicate.\r\nPals can be used to fight and breed, or they can be made to work on farms or factories.\r\nYou can even sell them or eat them.\r\n\r\n▼Survival\r\nIn a harsh environment where food is scarce and vicious poachers roam, danger waits around every corner. To survive, you must tread carefully and make difficult choices...even if that means eating your own Pals when the time comes.\r\n\r\n▼Mounts & Exploration\r\nPals can be mounted to traverse the land, sea and sky—allowing you to traverse all kinds of environment as you explore the world.\r\n\r\n▼Building Structures\r\nWant to build a pyramid? Put an army of Pals on the job. There are no labor laws for Pals, so exploit them to your heart's content.\r\n\r\n▼Production\r\nFind a variety of useful Pals to make fire, generate electricity, or mine ore so that you can live a life of comfort.\r\n\r\n▼Farming\r\nSome Pals are good at planting seeds, while others are skilled at watering or harvesting crops. Work together with your Pals to create an idyllic farmstead.\r\n\r\n▼Factories & Automation\r\nLetting Pals do the work is the key to automation. Build a factory, place a Pal in it, and they'll keep working as long as they're fed—until they're dead, that is.\r\n\r\n▼Dungeon Exploration\r\nWith Pals on your side you can tackle even the most dangerous areas. When the time comes, you might have to sacrifice one to save your skin. They'll protect your life—even if it costs their own.\r\n\r\n▼Breeding & Genetics\r\nBreed a Pal and it will inherit the characteristics of its parents. Combine rare pals to create the strongest Pal of them all!\r\n\r\n▼Poaching & Crime\r\nEndangered Pals live in wildlife sanctuaries. Sneak in and capture rare Pals to get rich quick! It's not a crime if you don't get caught, after all.\r\n\r\n▼Multiplayer\r\nMultiplayer is supported, so invite a friend and go on an adventure together! And of course you can battle your friends and trade Pals, too.\r\nNote: PvP will be implemented in a future update\r\n\r\nCollect all kinds of exciting Pals to fight, farm, build, and work for you in this completely new multiplayer, open world survival and crafting

Since its release, PAYDAY-players have been reveling in the thrill of a perfectly planned and executed heist. That’s what makes PAYDAY a high-octane, co-op FPS experience without equal.\r\n\r\nStep out of retirement back into the life of crime in the shoes of the Payday Gang, the envy of their peers and the nightmare of law-enforcement wherever they go. Several years after the crew’s reign of terror over Washington DC has ended, they assemble once again to deal with the threat that roused them out of early retirement.\r\n\r\nThe Tightest Crew\r\n\r\nThe legendary Payday Crew, dreaded by the law and underworld alike, is back. Ripped from their peaceful retirement to rejoin the criminal world by a new threat, one born from the chaos the Crew left in their wake.\r\n\r\nIn order to identify and crush this new threat, the Crew is leaving their Washington DC roots behind them and moving to New York City. A new location will bring with it new challenges, but also new opportunities for a heister with a plan.\r\n\r\nGive in to your greed\r\n\r\nGive outlet to your greed and let loose in PAYDAY 3. In addition to gold, cash and jewelry and any other valuables they might come across, you’ll be able to build a sizable collection of weapons, cosmetics and accolades.\r\n\r\nIt won’t be as simple as showing up and gaining goodies. You’ll have to work hard and plan smart to get away with as much loot as possible. Gain experience, unlock new skills and gain proficiency in weapons to steadily grow your power to handle the tougher challenges.\r\n\r\nThe Art of Heisting\r\n\r\nA professional heister knows it takes planning, hard work and a good amount of luck in order to execute a successful heist. In PAYDAY 3 the choice is put in the hands of the players, deciding how to tackle the heist, whether you sneak or go in guns blazing, whether you let your hostages go or keep them around as pawns, whether you go at it alone or bring friends. The choices are endless and in your hands, they will vastly change how the game plays.\r\n\r\nThrive in Co-op\r\n\r\nNot just anyone is worthy of standing at your side for something as important as a heist. Likewise, PAYDAY 3 is best enjoyed with close friends in mind, whether you bring them from your childhood or make them along the road.\r\n\r\nThe PAYDAY-series has always valued the bonds made through hardship and tries to reflect that in the actions and words of our heisters while in the game, and through our community while on the outside.\r\n\r\nAccount with Starbreeze Nebula required to play PAYDAY 3."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"payday-3","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41648.13779457877292855.4803a4b4-94cc-4b12-bf91-ad49bcb0c65c.f14df05b-5717-4af8-a8ab-6201e4159608","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54257.13779457877292855.4803a4b4-94cc-4b12-bf91-ad49bcb0c65c.0c055b53-1d9a-4f03-b4fc-dd316467a5af","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36413.13779457877292855.4803a4b4-94cc-4b12-bf91-ad49bcb0c65c.38b89a08-f322-4890-87f9-8997b485836a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61289.13779457877292855.4803a4b4-94cc-4b12-bf91-ad49bcb0c65c.9dd7499c-c4cd-4d65-8289-ec45686bbd17","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42482.13779457877292855.4803a4b4-94cc-4b12-bf91-ad49bcb0c65c.f5958f4e-ee58-4814-a63c-8b4aec3e4a77"],"ReleaseDate":5249995070427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":30501097472},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-series-x","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Puzzle & trivia"],"MetacriticUrls":{"Xbox360":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/peggle/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-360"},"MetaScore":{"Xbox360":89},"ID":"BSCCQL7DZ9KD","Title":{"en-us":"Peggle"},"Description":{"en-us":"Experience the ball-bouncing, peg-busting phenomenon!

Featuring turn-based tactical combat on procedurally generated maps, and resource management on a global scale, Phoenix Point offers endless replayability and a brutal challenge.\r\n\r\nFollowing a global environmental disaster, the Pandoravirus appeared and began reshaping creatures, including humans, into hideous mutants. Unable to stop the progress of the virus, much of human civilization was wiped out -- only small enclaves remain, separated by their principles and the vast landscape. The Phoenix Project, an ancient failsafe against global catastrophe is the only hope to unite mankind and take back the planet.\r\n\r\nLead the Phoenix Project from its base at Phoenix Point. Research and develop new technologies and techniques, plan operations, build alliances to unite the planet-- or simply destroy your rivals. It's up to you to save the planet and rebuild civilization, but there may be much more to the alien threat than meets the eye.\r\n\r\n* Mutating Alien Menace: Face down an ever-changing alien threat that adapts to your tactics and offers no respite even as your team becomes more powerful and technologically advanced.\r\n\r\n* Uncover the Secrets of the Pandoravirus: Phoenix Point features a complex narrative, with multiple endings that the player can only uncover via multiple playthroughs. Discover a secret history, as you learn about the origins of the mutants, the Pandoravirus, and Phoenix Point itself through exploration, diplomacy, and research.\r\n\r\n* Manage Diplomatic Relations: The Phoenix Project is not the only organization trying to reclaim the Earth. The militaristic New Jericho, the mystical Disciples of Anu, and the technophiles of Synedrion all offer unique rewards for co-operation and threats for opposition. It is up to you to decide how, or even if, to deal with them.\r\n\r\n* Take Aim on the Battlefield: In addition to equipping and commanding units, Phoenix Point lets you take direct control of your soldier's shots in combat, with a unique free-aiming system. Target enemy weakspots, weapons, or valuables, or just go for center mass.\r\n\r\n* Next-Gen Tech with Classic Pedigree: Phoenix Point was designed by Julian Gollop, the creator of the X-COM series in the 1990s. Keeping the core ethos of X-COM while updating the visuals, technology, and systems to modern standards has made Phoenix Point best-in-class."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"phoenix-point","OriginalPlatforms":[3],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23750.14507726714197033.ea391b48-d8cb-4724-a6cb-765168bd5161.0029c50b-c234-475e-9928-0185fc83e0aa","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27297.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.8f0d79d4-fb71-4169-bb64-0b77cac69f7f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3522.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.17680a69-6b0d-4293-a53c-6d16fe0035fd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39128.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.c1af4919-7997-458a-ae19-4b9cf83ecfaa","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63541.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.c3d3f2f0-5855-4872-bbdd-720b19605e27","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34869.14507726714197033.2905aa3c-57a0-457d-a5be-f0eea3e80cf3.dd0e9d28-4298-463e-98c1-032a9fa45f9c"],"ReleaseDate":5248809122427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":25358311424},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-one"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":80},"ID":"C4R4RB3SB1NN","Title":{"en-us":"Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy"},"Description":{"en-us":"The classic courtroom adventure series that has sold over 6.7 million copies worldwide is finally here.

His true love, Elaine Marley, has turned her focus away from governing and Guybrush himself is adrift and unfulfilled, having never found the Secret of Monkey Island. Hip, young pirate leaders led by Captain Madison have shuffled the old guard from power, Melee Island has taken a turn for the worse, and famed businessman Stan has been imprisoned for ‘marketing-related crimes’.\r\n\r\nBanter with old friends and new faces on familiar islands now under dangerous new leadership. Then, take to the high seas and explore the new and unknown as you work your way out of tough predicaments.

Isolated and lost inside this dream-like world, you will explore different interconnected regions in a non-linear fashion. The unsettling environment is a character itself.\r\n\r\nEvery location contains its own theme (story), puzzles and characters that are integral in creating a cohesive world. Throughout the game you will open up new areas, acquire different skill sets, weapons, various items and try to comprehend the sights presented to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAMEPLAY FEATURES\r\n\r\nCohesive “lived-in” world\r\nScorn takes place in an open-ended world with different interconnected regions. Each region is a maze-like structure with various rooms and paths to discover. All the storytelling happens in-game, with no cut-scenes to distract you from the grisly reality of the living, breathing world you’re in. But keep your eyes open - the game won’t show you any sympathy if you miss something important on your uneasy travels.\r\n\r\nFull body awareness\r\nPlayers will experience better immersion being aware of the character’s body and movement. Interaction with the world is realistic - objects are picked up with your hands (instead of just floating in midair), machines and instruments are operated by grabbing the controls, etc.\r\n\r\nInventory and ammo management\r\nYour loadout is defined and limited. This plays a big role in keeping the player in an even greater state of awareness throughout the whole game. Players will have to think about when to fight and when to take cover and how their actions affect the world around them. Different play styles will be needed to advance."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"scorn","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22978.13699799412731780.9f7b812e-456c-430e-8cec-380f1ca9e4a2.2f448ff0-73c4-4053-b93d-54c8144069c7","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33685.13699799412731780.1afb5b8c-d3cf-40b3-aa5e-f5e01adefd6c.87ee6d2e-f1cb-4e6f-93ba-bb9dcd19c7f3","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35190.13699799412731780.1afb5b8c-d3cf-40b3-aa5e-f5e01adefd6c.f72daed6-dfd2-4e60-8778-aacfb8c9237a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48298.13699799412731780.1afb5b8c-d3cf-40b3-aa5e-f5e01adefd6c.c725ebb9-5d37-4944-af96-f958e2889a5a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37450.13699799412731780.1afb5b8c-d3cf-40b3-aa5e-f5e01adefd6c.d6076fd6-7d4a-4966-8edd-9e32615e69ce","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53591.13699799412731780.1afb5b8c-d3cf-40b3-aa5e-f5e01adefd6c.e52f2509-36f8-4b39-959b-535d10080615","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50110.13699799412731780.1afb5b8c-d3cf-40b3-aa5e-f5e01adefd6c.853962a3-416b-4b46-a874-b93d6855794f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.900.13699799412731780.1afb5b8c-d3cf-40b3-aa5e-f5e01adefd6c.a2adda86-943d-4770-9686-f0da5fff3393","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14480.13699799412731780.1afb5b8c-d3cf-40b3-aa5e-f5e01adefd6c.98aca120-3724-4dc0-b554-f861e24b4681","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37351.13699799412731780.1afb5b8c-d3cf-40b3-aa5e-f5e01adefd6c.cabdb71e-7318-49ac-913b-0ba25ba38a49","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61479.13699799412731780.1afb5b8c-d3cf-40b3-aa5e-f5e01adefd6c.d2d4d6d3-b647-4fce-b474-ec9fa6ee18e3"],"ReleaseDate":5249699402427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":20053176320},"MetacriticPlatform":"xbox-series-x","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Strategy","Simulation"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/screamride/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-one"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":71},"ID":"BQ4M1XWXFKHB","Title":{"en-us":"ScreamRide"},"Description":{"en-us":"This game features stunning high definition graphics, hundreds of customizable building components, physics-based destruction, cinematic collisions, unlockable levels, in-game leaderboards, global rankings and more.

Siberia is large enough for you to fight & explore for as much as you want.\r\n\r\nBEASTS OF THE APOCALYPSE\r\nOnly the strongest souls survive in Siberia, and Mental knows it well.

Magic has returned to the world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Technology merges with flesh and consciousness. Elves, trolls, orks and dwarves walk among us, while ruthless corporations bleed the world dry. You are a shadowrunner - a mercenary living on the fringes of society, in the shadows of massive corporate arcologies, surviving day-by-day on skill and instinct alone. When the powerful or the desperate need a job done, you get it done... by any means necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the urban sprawl of the Seattle metroplex, the search for a mysterious killer sets you on a trail that leads from the darkest slums to the city’s most powerful megacorps. You will need to tread carefully, enlist the aid of other runners, and master powerful forces of technology and magic in order to emerge from the shadows of Seattle unscathed.\r\n\r\nThe unique cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation over 30 years ago. Return to the world of Shadowrun, with this cult-classic turn-based tactical RPG finally ported to consoles.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\nGripping Tactical Combat: When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With the variety of weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices. A successful run requires commanding a team of runners with the right balance of combat, tech, and magical abilities.\r\n\r\nSkill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun Returns’ classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose. Want to start summoning spirits as an ork Shaman and evolve into a cybered-up weapon specialist? Do it!\r\n\r\nEngaging 2D/3D Art Style: Shadowrun Returns mixes dynamic 3D characters and lighting with a vibrant, hand-painted environment. Illustrated character portraits bring every conversation to life. Explore a world filled with detail, from the slums of the Redmond Barrens to the extravagant offices of powerful corporations.\r\n\r\nUpdated/Redesigned UI: To better experience this cult-classic on consoles, the UI has been redesigned to meet the needs of console players!

Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall.\r\n\r\nIt’s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge’s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the “Flux State” controls the city of Berlin. It’s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there’s no better place to earn a quick payday.\r\n\r\nNow, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return…\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\nA Classic, Story-Driven cRPG adapted to consoles: Dragonfall hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG’s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development. Immerse yourself in a smart, 20+ hour campaign with a diverse cast of all-too-human characters.\r\n\r\nA One-of-a-Kind Cyberpunk Setting: Experience the unique “Tech meets Magic” dystopian future of Shadowrun, a fan-favorite game setting. Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut is the perfect entry point to the setting for those with no prior Shadowrun experience, while providing plenty of classic Shadowrun characters and tech for veteran players to sink their teeth into.\r\n\r\nCommand Your Team: Lead a small team of shadowrunners - each with their own outlook, motivations, and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. But it’s not all about the mission - each team member also has challenges to face in their own lives, which you can choose to brush aside or play an important part in.\r\n\r\nGripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat: When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters.

Fight your way across the most immersive maps yet, with many real-world locations captured in stunning detail, and an improved traversal system that lets you explore more of them than ever before.\r\nFrance, 1944 – As part of a covert US Rangers operation to weaken the Atlantikwall fortifications along the coast of Brittany, elite marksman Karl Fairburne makes contact with the French Resistance. Soon they uncover a secret Nazi project that threatens to end the war before the Allies can even invade Europe: Operation Kraken.\r\n\r\nEXPANSIVE CAMPAIGN\r\nMany real-world locations have been captured using photogrammetry to recreate a living, immersive environment, and multiple infiltration and extraction points and kill list targets provide a whole new perspective on each mission. Take on the Nazi plot solo or work with a partner, with improved co-op mechanics allowing you to share ammo and items, give orders and heal each other.\r\n\r\nADVANCED GUNPLAY PHYSICS AND TRAVERSAL\r\nUse ziplines, slide down slopes and shimmy along ledges to reach the perfect vantage point, or to sneak past a sharp-eyed lookout. Factor in rifle stock and barrel options along with gravity, wind and heart rate while you line up your sights on the target.\r\n\r\nHIGH CALIBRE CUSTOMISATION\r\nUse workbenches to customise and upgrade virtually every aspect of your weapon – change scopes, stocks, barrels, magazines and more. Rifles, secondaries and pistols all have a huge variety of options. On top of that you can select the ammo to suit your target, from armour-piercing right down to non-lethal.\r\n\r\nINVASION MODE – CAMPAIGN DROP IN PvP AND CO-OP\r\nInvade another player’s Campaign as an Axis sniper and engage in a deadly game of cat and mouse, providing a new dimension to the challenge as you stalk your prey. Alternatively, as Karl you can call for assistance and have a second sniper drop in to help you out of a tricky situation.\r\n\r\nTENSE ADVERSIAL MULTIPLAYER\r\nCustomise your character and loadout and earn XP, medals and ribbons as you take on intensely competitive 16 player battles that will really test your sharpshooting skills.

Players build space ships, wheeled vehicles, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and uses (civil and military), pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive. Featuring both creative and survival modes, there is no limit to what can be built, utilized and explored.\r\n\r\nSpace Engineers features a realistic, volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. The game can be played either in single or multiplayer modes.\r\n\r\nVolumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity.\r\n\r\nSpace Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn't use technologies that wouldn't be feasible in the near future.\r\n\r\nSpace Engineers concentrates on construction and exploration aspects, but can be played as a survival shooter as well. We expect players will avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications to survive in space and on planets.

Who the heck are you?! Can you see me? You CAN, can't you? You've drunk the Spirittea and now you can see me!! Look, we've got problems! This town is crawling with troublemaking spirits. They've become lost because humans have stopped worshipping, leaving offerings or even thinking about them anymore.\r\n\r\nThis is- well... used to be a nice town, but there have been some strange goings-on lately! You're going to find the spirits causing mayhem and fix their problems so they can become paying customers, and get to know the townspeople and explore the mountain to its fullest!\r\n\r\nHere's the stuff you'll want to get involved in:\r\n\r\n-Solving the spirit's problems - To remember themselves, they'll need anything from some spicy noodles to finding and digging up their lost treasures, so get your problem-solving hat on!\r\n-Making friends with the locals - The townspeople all have their own schedules, likes, dislikes and hobbies to take part in - from bug catching to karaoke, there's something for everyone!\r\n-Managing the bathhouse - You'll need to clean towels, chop wood to heat the baths and seat the spirits with their friends for the ultimate bathing experience.\r\n-Upgrading and decorating - The local shops can make a whole lot of cool furniture and help you fix up overgrown areas of the bathhouse. We should make it big and fancy enough to take on all the spirits!\r\n\r\nTHE BATHHOUSE\r\n\r\nThe bathhouse is an ancient spirit building hidden up in the mountain, and it's up to you to clean it up and fill it full of customers! Once the spirits are in the bathhouse, you'll need to clean towels, chop wood to heat the baths and seat the spirits with their friends for the ultimate bathing experience. Each spirit has their own preferences so you'll need to get to know them all and upgrade the bathhouse to become the best bathhouse keeper around.\r\n\r\nTo keep your bathhouse running, you'll need to:\r\n-Keep the bathhouse and towels clean - Grab your trusty broom to sweep away the cobwebs and collect up all your towels, you'll need to keep everything clean, dry and organised.\r\n-Deliver a five-star service with food and scrubbing - Get ready to pamper your spirits with food straight from your kitchen and a give them a good scrub while they're relaxing! \r\n-Make the water perfect for each spirit - Chop wood for the boilers to heat up the water to the perfect temperature and mix up various elixirs to make the water perfect for each spirit - they'll all have their preferences and favourite recipes!\r\n-Sit friends together and enemies apart - Every spirit has others they like best, as well as some they don't enjoy spending time with at all! You'll have to plan carefully when you lead spirits to their baths - don't seat just anyone together! Unless, of course, you don't care about making money.  Which I do.  Very much so in-fact."},"Affirmations":[0],"MetaCriticPathName":"spirittea","OriginalPlatforms":[5],"InVaultTime":2,"PosterUrl":"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60550.14327532839373067.e3a24cb8-3eb5-47ad-8d1b-19797522f44c.7f370a1c-e01f-4c2e-9c1a-38f0f333bd52","IsMetacriticInfoCorrect":true,"IsMetacriticInfoExist":true,"ScreenShots":["https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3053.14327532839373067.e3a24cb8-3eb5-47ad-8d1b-19797522f44c.036d2911-fe17-4aba-822e-64aba46268e3","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37013.14327532839373067.e3a24cb8-3eb5-47ad-8d1b-19797522f44c.034b4bf6-c19c-4cd9-8b44-715cc08c95dc","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28380.14327532839373067.e3a24cb8-3eb5-47ad-8d1b-19797522f44c.f3bfe34b-56e6-4a24-9718-b511bef1d192","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16574.14327532839373067.e3a24cb8-3eb5-47ad-8d1b-19797522f44c.511e64d7-921b-4723-ab46-81404dbfb78b","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36876.14327532839373067.e3a24cb8-3eb5-47ad-8d1b-19797522f44c.0b87662b-f492-4eef-b26a-531ff7d3640f","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41709.14327532839373067.e3a24cb8-3eb5-47ad-8d1b-19797522f44c.01580892-e785-462d-b6f1-5fdab53ccc46","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60848.14327532839373067.e3a24cb8-3eb5-47ad-8d1b-19797522f44c.ec316c84-f3f0-44d2-bb6d-5d896d0d51f2","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15384.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.39caf6af-2ae3-4fc6-b705-40eaa2ccacb4","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10292.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.9a8d0528-bd30-46a1-9b58-73cbcab980ae","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25878.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.86c3187c-9611-45c7-a60d-b0129df9042d","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17950.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.3f9c0fcc-1be3-429a-ad72-8b034452b97a","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37380.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.43b5e386-d0ea-4524-a399-05f6ef8bc1bb","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57507.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.7ec79986-d6e9-4f71-a461-e7cec6882880","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54983.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.5aa55e81-628f-49c2-8b4a-d0c323847544","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15853.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.33cc295b-4f78-4ad2-890c-d4c50bd21c96","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8011.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.fcbcad15-7cee-4101-974e-e80cd1c79d1c","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64599.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.add8d349-8f27-4761-80ae-15c630dc71cf","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6518.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.b434e9e0-84bc-41c6-b94e-6a8643f45cb0","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44976.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.d7b8393d-e0f6-41c0-8d76-6047e015d5df","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55571.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.c21d450c-8a23-4f28-acc6-569e597540bd","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8843.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.c2b2b5e6-0309-49fe-8b72-5bd3ed072ab9","https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56939.14327532839373067.542dfe9e-687c-4ebe-8234-9618b5be7b0f.4d3ced40-f2d2-4608-83a8-b7f818db8f00"],"ReleaseDate":5250040898427387904,"DownloadSize":{"US":429752320},"MetacriticPlatform":"pc","AvaliablePlatforms":[]},{"Categories":["Action & adventure","Family & kids","Platformer"],"MetacriticUrls":{"XboxOne":"https://www.metacritic.com/game/spongebob-squarepants-battle-for-bikini-bottom---rehydrated/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-one"},"MetaScore":{"XboxOne":71},"ID":"C35S5BRNWL70","Title":{"en":"SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated"},"Description":{"en":"Are you ready, kids?

This narratively-driven single player game puts you in the role of a Jedi Padawan who narrowly escaped the purge of Order 66 following the events of Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith. On a quest to rebuild the Jedi Order, you must pick up the pieces of your shattered past to complete your training, develop new powerful Force abilities, and master the art of the iconic lightsaber - all while staying one step ahead of the Empire and its deadly Inquisitors. \r\n\r\nWhile mastering your abilities, players will engage in cinematically-charged lightsaber and Force combat designed to deliver the kind of intense STAR WARS lightsaber battles as seen in the films. Players will need to approach enemies strategically, sizing up strengths and weaknesses while cleverly utilizing your Jedi training to overcome your opponents and solve the mysteries that lay in your path. \r\n\r\nSTAR WARS fans will recognize iconic locations, weapons, gear, and enemies while also meeting a roster of fresh characters, locations, creatures, droids and adversaries new to STAR WARS. As part of this authentic STAR WARS story, fans will delve into a galaxy recently seized by the Empire. As a Jedi hero-turned-fugitive, players will need to fight for survival while exploring the mysteries of a long-extinct civilization all in an effort to rebuild the remnants of the Jedi Order as the Empire seeks to erase the Jedi completely.\r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES\r\n\r\n● Cinematic, Immersive Combat – Jedi: Fallen Order delivers the fantasy of becoming a Jedi through its innovative lightsaber combat system – striking, parrying, dodging - partnered with a suite of powerful Force abilities you’ll need to leverage to overcome obstacles that stand in your way. This combat system is intuitive to pick up, but takes training and practice to fully master its nuances as you gain new powers and abilities along your adventure.\r\n\r\n● A New Jedi Story Begins - As a former Padawan on the run from the Empire, you must complete your training before Imperial Inquisitors discover your plan to revive the Jedi Order. Aided by a former Jedi Knight, a cantankerous pilot, and a fearless droid, you must escape the evil machinations of the Empire in a story-driven adventure. Explore and overcome a wide range of challenges focused on combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. \r\n\r\n● The Galaxy Awaits - Ancient forests, windswept rock faces, and haunted jungles are all unique biomes you’ll explore in Jedi: Fallen Order, with the freedom to decide when and where you go next. As you unlock new powers and abilities, opportunities open up to re-traverse maps in new ways; leveraging the Force to augment the way you explore. Move quickly, however, as the Empire is actively hunting your every step in their effort to exterminate all remnants of the Jedi Order.\r\n\r\nConditions & restrictions apply.

But this isn’t a joyride! Ali is on an all-important mission to save her family video store from the nasty loan sharks trying to shut their shop down.\r\n\r\nSwindle strangers, pickpocket people, and con commoners across a wacky America of the ‘90s. And – it should go without saying – lie to your mom about all of it. Choose who deserves to be conned and who might need a helping hand. The world is your oyster (and hey, pearls are worth a lot!).\r\n\r\nOne Con Doesn’t Fool All  \r\nCon people your way! Wear disguises, sneak around, eavesdrop on conversations, and learn how to approach each mark. Maybe you think you can make enough cheddar just by pickpocketing. Or seek out more complex grifts that involve breaking and entering, smooth talking, and more. It’s up to you to outsmart everyone and lockpick everything that stands between you and saving your mom's video store.\r\n\r\nA Coming-of-Age Comedy\r\nIf there’s one surefire way to discover yourself, it’s by setting out on an adventure. Luckily for you, you’ve got the aid of an expert grifter to coach you in the elusive art of charm. But a life of crime is no laughing matter! Not unless you turn on the laugh track and make it a criminally funny sitcom. Get ready to talk your way into deals, hearts, and trouble. And don’t forget to call home every once in a while to check in with your mom. Sure, you might argue with her sometimes (most of the time?), but you’re a teenager - that’s kind of your job!\r\n\r\nThe Weird and Wack 1990s the Way You Remember Them\r\nWhether you were a ‘90s kid or not, this game is brimming with nostalgia. It offers you the perfect opportunity to relive your own awkward high school years, or if you sadly missed out on the ‘90s, finally experience all of the classic teen movies that feel so old and outdated. Plaid, payphones, VHS tapes, and malls – THE BIG CON has got all of the outrageous fads you remember (and some you want to forget) from the 1990s.\r\n\r\nBut most importantly – you can ride the Hormipillar as much as you want!

Butterworth, whilst guiding a troop of tin soldiers to reach their goal. Critically acclaimed for its moving narrative, refined puzzle design, and immersive atmosphere, Tin Hearts is a narrative puzzle adventure where the ghosts of the past emerge to tell a resonating tale of family, love, and compromise.  \r\n\r\nSpanning across four distinctive acts with 50+ puzzles masterfully woven throughout a grand Victorian home, steadily uncover a variety of whimsical inventions with unique abilities to provide a safe route of passage for the tin soldiers to travel. From the meticulous garden, where the soldiers can bounce, glide and soar to their goal, or the inventor’s basement filled with the heights of innovation and technology, each location has an abundance of treasured memories, whilst there are some that would rather be forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn a tragic fable which will see Albert overwhelmed by sorrow and heartache, discover what brilliant minds do when the love for life, and the love for invention, are threatened by life itself. \r\n\r\nSOLVE A TRAIL OF PUZZLES: Set out on an immersive adventure through 50+ lemmings-like puzzles which constantly evolve as you progress. Uncover new routes to your destination each time you play, with multiple ways to solve the intricate puzzles. \r\n\r\nEXPERIENCE A RESONATING TALE: In a multi-layered and heartfelt narrative, told through treasured memories, photographs and hand-written letters, there is much to be uncovered in Tin Hearts.

Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is the new co-op focused experience from the award-winning team behind the Vermintide series.\r\n\r\nIn the depths of the hive, the seeds of corruption threaten to turn into an overwhelming tide of darkness. A mysterious and sinister new force is seeking to take control of the entire city. It is up to you and your allies in the Inquisition to root out the enemy before the city succumbs to Chaos.\r\n\r\nAs Tertium falls, Rejects Will Rise.\r\n\r\nHigh Octane Hybrid Combat\r\nBuilt on the legacy of Vermintide 2’s best-in-class melee combat, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide introduces intense WH40K gunplay to the mix. Master the balance between ranged and melee combat as you fight through a slew of enemies. Feel the impact of each swipe, swing, and slice of a chainsword, or fry some flesh with a lasgun.\r\n\r\nDie Alone or Suffer Together\r\nDarktide is a co-op game. Wandering too far, risks punishment by foes looking to immobilize or capture stray Rejects, such as the slavering Chaos Hound or the Moebian Trapper. Once you fall prey to such foes, only your teammates can save you! More than that, your innate toughness – your determination to press on through the pain – only recharges when you are in the proximity of your strike team.\r\n\r\nYour Character. Your Playstyle. \r\nCreate your own, unique character and customize their physical appearance, voice, and origin. Choose your class to determine which unique traits and skill sets they will make use of in battle. Will you be a seasoned veteran of the Imperial army, a snarky outsider, or a fiery zealot? The choice is yours.\r\n\r\nTertium - A Hive City on the Brink of Collapse\r\nStep into the violent, dystopian world of Warhammer 40,000.

Fresh out of a three-year prison sentence, an older and weathered Kiryu comes to find out that his surrogate daughter, Haruka, has gone missing from the orphanage he looks after. The trail leads him to his old stomping grounds in Kamurocho, where he discovers that she has been struck by a car and now lies in a coma. To make matters worse, Kiryu learns that Haruka now has a son that he must look after. With baby in hand, Kiryu journeys to the seaside town of Onomichi, Hiroshima to unravel the truth about Haruka, her son, and a sinister secret that the Hiroshima yakuza are harboring.\r\n\r\nFrom the unparalleled realism of the new setting of Onomichi, a beautiful, sleepy port town in Hiroshima Prefecture, to the latest evolution of Kamurocho, the biggest red-light district in Tokyo, Yakuza 6 is the ultimate iteration the game's blend of gritty crime story, hyper-explosive combat, and all the vices and distractions those locales have to offer.\r\n\r\nEnter the “Dragon Engine” - Explore the world of Yakuza like never before. Yakuza 6 is the first current-gen Yakuza title that was developed from the ground up for the current-gen hardware, introducing the seedy Japanese underworld with detailed visuals, lifelike animations, a new physics engine, interactive storefronts, seamless transitions and more.\r\n\r\nExplore Kamurocho Reborn and the Scenic Views of Onomichi - The hypnotic lights, opportunistic inhabitants, and hedonistic distractions of Kamurocho look better than ever. Revamped minigames like karaoke, batting cages, darts, hostesses, and the SEGA arcade have been streamlined for maximum pleasure, and new additions like the RIZAP Gym, Cat Café, and Clan Creator are the purrfect distractions after a long night of bashing heads! But it’s also time to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life to play tourist in beautiful Onomichi. This tranquil coastal community is home to plenty of local activities like bar mingling, spearfishing (think action-packed rail shooter … with fish), and more!\r\n\r\nLet the Bodies Hit the Floor - Yakuza 6 Kiryu is a 100% certified badass, so that means he’s a battle-hardened veteran when it comes to the art of street fighting. Although he utilizes one fighting style this time around, you best believe Kiryu hits like a truck. Devastating combos and bone-breaking Heat Actions make a return, but now the Dragon of Dojima can fill up a meter to engage Extreme Heat Mode. When activated, Kiryu glows blue and unleashes heavy-damage combos with his fists or any “tool” that’s close at hand.\r\n\r\nFully Voiced Japanese Audio - For the first time in series history, every line and piece of dialogue is fully voiced in Japanese.
